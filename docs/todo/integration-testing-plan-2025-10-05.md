# Integration Testing & Reading Environment Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Focus**: Integration testing of recovery systems with reader, Readwise import, reading experience validation
**Context**: Reader UI exists, backend systems built, need end-to-end validation
**Budget**: $1.00 max for AI testing

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Insight from Developer
**"You're building a READING ENVIRONMENT, not just a sync tool."**

This reframes everything:
- ‚úÖ **Core Priority**: Reader where you CREATE annotations, SEE connections, TUNE weights
- ‚úÖ **Data Bootstrap**: Readwise import (one-time migration of historical highlights)
- ‚úÖ **Testing Focus**: Does recovery/remapping work IN PRACTICE while reading?
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **Defer**: Obsidian sync (one-way export for backup, later)

### Current State Assessment

**‚úÖ BUILT - Reader Infrastructure**:
- `ReaderLayout.tsx` - Main layout with state management for visible chunks
- `VirtualizedReader.tsx` - Performance-optimized document display
- `RightPanel.tsx` - 4 tabs (Connections, Annotations, Review, Weights)
- `ConnectionsList.tsx` - Connection surfacing for visible chunks
- `AnnotationReviewTab.tsx` - Recovery results UI
- `WeightTuning.tsx` - Engine weight adjustment interface

**‚úÖ BUILT - Backend Systems**:
- `recover-annotations.ts` - Annotation recovery with fuzzy matching
- `remap-connections.ts` - Connection remapping after edits
- `fuzzy-matching.ts` - Multi-strategy position recovery
- `readwise-import.ts` - Readwise JSON import (has bugs)
- `obsidian-sync.ts` - Obsidian file export (deprioritized)

**‚ùå UNTESTED - Integration Points**:
- Does annotation recovery work when reading and editing documents?
- Does connection remapping preserve connections during reprocessing?
- Does Readwise import correctly position historical highlights?
- Do the 3 engines properly surface connections in the reader?

**üîç GAPS IDENTIFIED**:
- Reader UI exists but integration testing missing
- Recovery systems built but not validated in real usage
- No metrics on success rates (recovery %, remapping accuracy)
- Unknown: Does the full flow work end-to-end?

---

## Today's Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Test Readwise Import** - Bootstrap historical highlights into the system
2. **Validate Recovery Pipeline** - Test annotation recovery through reader UI
3. **Test Connection Remapping** - Verify connections survive document edits
4. **Measure Success Rates** - Quantify recovery accuracy, remapping precision
5. **Identify Integration Gaps** - Document what doesn't work in practice

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Readwise import >60% exact match rate
- [ ] Annotation recovery >90% success on light edits
- [ ] Connection remapping >95% similarity on auto-remap
- [ ] Total cost <$1.00
- [ ] Zero data corruption
- [ ] All findings documented

---

## Phase 1: Reader State Assessment (30 min)
**Time**: 9:00-9:30
**Goal**: Understand what's actually working in the reader

### Task 1.1: Audit Reader Capabilities
**Action Items**:
1. Start dev environment: `npm run dev`
2. Upload test PDF, verify processing completes
3. Open reader at `/read/[id]`
4. Test each reader feature:
   - [ ] Markdown displays correctly
   - [ ] Can create new annotation (text selection ‚Üí save)
   - [ ] Annotations persist and display
   - [ ] Connections tab shows related chunks
   - [ ] Weight tuning sliders work
   - [ ] Review tab appears when recovery results exist

**Documentation**: Screenshot any broken features, note what works

### Task 1.2: Identify Integration Gaps
Based on testing, create list of:
- ‚úÖ **Working**: Features that function correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**: Features that work but have issues
- ‚ùå **Broken**: Features that fail completely
- üîç **Untested**: Features we haven't validated yet

**Output**: `docs/todo/reader-state-assessment.md`

**Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ Core reading works ‚Üí Continue to Phase 2
- ‚ùå Critical reader bugs ‚Üí Fix before testing backend integration

---

## Phase 2: Fix Critical Bugs (45 min)
**Time**: 9:30-10:15
**Goal**: Fix blocking bugs identified in recovery pipeline testing plan

### Task 2.1: Fix Readwise Import Type Mismatch
**File**: `worker/handlers/readwise-import.ts`
**Issue**: `findAnnotationMatch` expects full `Annotation` type, getting partial object

**Current Code** (line ~142):
```typescript
const fuzzyMatch = findAnnotationMatch(
  { text, originalChunkIndex: estimatedChunkIndex },  // ‚ùå Missing fields
  markdown,
  chunks
)
```

**Fix**:
```typescript
const fuzzyMatch = findAnnotationMatch(
  {
    text,
    originalChunkIndex: estimatedChunkIndex,
    startOffset: 0,  // Placeholder - fuzzy match will set correct value
    endOffset: text.length,
    id: `readwise-temp-${highlight.id || Date.now()}`
  },
  markdown,
  chunks
)
```

**Validation**: `cd worker && npx tsc --noEmit`

### Task 2.2: Fix Obsidian Export Missing Parameter
**File**: `worker/handlers/obsidian-sync.ts`
**Issue**: `exportAnnotations` function missing `supabase` parameter

**Current Code** (line ~223):
```typescript
async function exportAnnotations(documentId: string, vaultFilePath: string) {
  const { data: components } = await supabase  // ‚ùå supabase undefined
```

**Fix**: Add parameter and update caller
```typescript
async function exportAnnotations(
  documentId: string,
  vaultFilePath: string,
  supabase: SupabaseClient
): Promise<void> {
  // ... implementation
}

// Update caller (line ~84):
if (obsidianSettings.syncAnnotations) {
  await exportAnnotations(documentId, vaultFilePath, supabase)
}
```

**Validation**: `cd worker && npx tsc --noEmit`

### Task 2.3: Verify Component Query Syntax
**File**: `worker/handlers/recover-annotations.ts` (line 23)
**Issue**: JSONB query syntax needs verification

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check actual component structure
npx supabase db query "
  SELECT component_type, data
  FROM components
  WHERE component_type = 'source'
  LIMIT 3;
"
```

**Options**:
- If `document_id` is top-level: `.eq('document_id', documentId)`
- If in JSONB data: `.eq('data->>document_id', documentId)`

**Fix**: Update query based on actual schema

**Validation**: Test query returns expected results

**Phase 2 Output**: All TypeScript errors resolved, handlers ready for testing

---

## Phase 3: Readwise Import Testing (1 hour)
**Time**: 10:15-11:15
**Goal**: Test Readwise import with real data, measure match rates

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Bugs from Phase 2 fixed
- [ ] Have Readwise export JSON ready
- [ ] Have corresponding PDF uploaded to Rhizome

### Task 3.1: Prepare Test Data (15 min)
**Action Items**:
1. Export highlights from Readwise:
   - Go to Readwise.io ‚Üí Export ‚Üí JSON
   - Select one book for testing
   - Download `readwise-export.json`

2. Upload corresponding PDF:
   - Upload same book to Rhizome
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Note document ID

3. Verify book match:
   - Compare Readwise book title vs Rhizome document title
   - Confirm they're the same book/edition

### Task 3.2: Run Readwise Import (30 min)
**Execute**:
```bash
cd worker
npx tsx scripts/test-readwise-import.ts <document-id> <readwise-export.json>
```

**Monitor**:
- Number of highlights in JSON
- Number successfully matched
- Match method distribution (exact, fuzzy, context, chunk-bounded)
- Failed imports (log text for debugging)

**Expected Results**:
- Clean PDF: 70-85% exact matches
- OCR PDF: 50-70% fuzzy matches
- Cost: <$0.15

### Task 3.3: Validate Import in Reader (15 min)
**Manual Verification**:
1. Open document in reader: `/read/<document-id>`
2. Check Annotations tab
3. Verify 5 random annotations:
   - [ ] Text matches Readwise highlight
   - [ ] Position is correct in document
   - [ ] Color/tag preserved
   - [ ] No duplicates

**Document Findings**:
- Match rate: X/Y highlights (Z%)
- Position accuracy: Correct/Total verified
- Issues found: [list specific problems]

**Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ Match rate >60% ‚Üí Readwise import proven, can use for bootstrap
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Match rate 40-60% ‚Üí Document issues, but usable with manual review
- ‚ùå Match rate <40% ‚Üí Import unreliable, investigate formatting mismatch

---

## Phase 4: Annotation Recovery Testing (1.5 hours)
**Time**: 11:15-12:45
**Goal**: Test recovery pipeline through reader UI (real usage scenario)

### Task 4.1: Setup Recovery Test Document (15 min)
**Action Items**:
1. Upload small PDF (50 pages)
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Open in reader, create 10 annotations:
   - 3 in beginning (chunks 0-5)
   - 4 in middle (chunks 10-15)
   - 3 near end (chunks 20-25)
4. Note annotation IDs and text for verification

### Task 4.2: Light Edit Recovery Test (30 min)
**Edit Scenario**: Add 1 paragraph mid-document (doesn't touch annotations)

**Steps**:
1. Export markdown from Supabase Storage
2. Edit file: Add paragraph at ~page 25
3. Upload edited version
4. Trigger reprocessing:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/reprocess-document.ts <document-id>
   ```
5. Monitor recovery process in worker logs

**Expected Recovery Flow**:
1. Worker detects existing annotations
2. Calls `recoverAnnotations()` with old/new chunks
3. Fuzzy matching finds positions
4. Updates annotations with new offsets
5. Stores recovery results

**Validation in Reader**:
1. Refresh reader page
2. Check Review tab (should show recovery results)
3. Verify annotations:
   - [ ] 9-10/10 recovered (>90% success rate)
   - [ ] Exact matches: ~7-8
   - [ ] Fuzzy matches: ~2-3
   - [ ] Lost: 0-1

**Metrics to Record**:
- Total annotations: 10
- Exact matches: X
- Fuzzy matches: Y
- Lost: Z
- Success rate: (X+Y)/10
- Average confidence: N

### Task 4.3: Heavy Edit Recovery Test (30 min)
**Edit Scenario**: Rewrite 2 paragraphs containing annotations

**Steps**:
1. Same document, create 5 new annotations
2. Export markdown
3. Significantly rewrite 2 paragraphs with annotations
4. Reprocess document
5. Check recovery results

**Expected Results**:
- Success rate: 60-80% (lower due to content changes)
- Some annotations marked "needs review"
- Graceful failure (not corrupted)

**Validation**:
- Check Review tab shows "Needs Review" section
- Verify suggested matches are reasonable
- Test accepting/rejecting suggestions

### Task 4.4: Document Recovery Patterns (15 min)
**Analysis**:
- Which recovery methods work best? (exact, context, trigram)
- What types of edits cause failures?
- Are confidence scores accurate?
- Any edge cases found?

**Output**: Update `docs/testing/annotation-recovery-findings.md`

---

## Phase 5: Connection Remapping Testing (1.5 hours)
**Time**: 13:00-14:30
**Goal**: Validate connection remapping preserves relationships

### Task 5.1: Setup Connection Test (15 min)
**Action Items**:
1. Use same test document
2. Let 3-engine system run (creates connections)
3. Query connections:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, connection_type, strength,
          source_chunk_id, target_chunk_id
   FROM connections
   WHERE source_chunk_id IN (SELECT id FROM chunks WHERE document_id = '<doc-id>')
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
4. Note 3-5 strong connections for tracking

### Task 5.2: Test Remapping After Edit (45 min)
**Edit Scenario**: Add 2 paragraphs to middle of document

**Steps**:
1. Export markdown
2. Add paragraphs around chunk 12 (shifts subsequent chunks)
3. Reprocess with remapping:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=true npx tsx scripts/reprocess-document.ts <document-id> --remap-connections
   ```
4. Monitor remapping in logs:
   - Old chunk content ‚Üí New chunk content matching
   - Similarity scores
   - Auto-remap vs needs-review decisions

**Expected Results**:
- Connections remapped automatically (similarity >0.95)
- No broken connections (pointing to wrong chunks)
- Metadata updated with remapping info

**Validation in Reader**:
1. Open Connections tab
2. Verify connections still make sense
3. Click connection ‚Üí navigates to correct chunk
4. Check connection strength preserved

### Task 5.3: Cross-Document Connection Test (30 min)
**Setup**:
1. Two documents (A and B)
2. Create connection between them (via shared concepts)
3. Edit document A only

**Test Flow**:
1. Note connection: A.chunk_X ‚Üí B.chunk_Y
2. Edit document A (add text before chunk_X)
3. Reprocess A
4. Verify connection remapped on A side
5. Verify B side unchanged (no duplicate remapping)

**Validation**: Connection points to correct content in both docs

### Task 5.4: Measure Remapping Accuracy (20 min)
**Metrics**:
- Total connections before edit: N
- Connections remapped: M
- Auto-remapped (>0.95 similarity): X
- Needs review (0.85-0.95): Y
- Lost (<0.85): Z
- Average similarity: S

**Decision Point**:
- ‚úÖ Accuracy >95% ‚Üí Remapping proven reliable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accuracy 85-95% ‚Üí Works but needs threshold tuning
- ‚ùå Accuracy <85% ‚Üí Investigate embedding similarity logic

2. Read first few chunks
3. Create 3 annotations on interesting passages
4. Switch to Connections tab
5. Explore connections for visible chunks
6. Click connection ‚Üí navigate to related chunk
7. Adjust weight sliders in Weights tab
8. Observe connection list changes
9. Create annotation on connected chunk

**Observations**:
- Does connection surfacing feel useful?
- Are weight adjustments intuitive?
- Does navigation work smoothly?
- Any UX friction points?

### Task 6.2: Test Recovery UI Flow (30 min)
**Scenario**: Edit document, review recovered annotations

**Steps**:
1. Document with annotations + connections
2. Make light edit (add paragraph)
3. Reprocess
4. Open reader ‚Üí Review tab appears
5. Review each recovered annotation:
   - Accept correct recoveries
   - Reject incorrect recoveries
