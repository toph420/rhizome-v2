# Maximum Reliability Chunking System

**Status:** Partially Implemented
**Goal:** 99.5%+ chunk matching reliability
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-07

---

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Implemented Today (Ready to Test)

1. **Few-Shot Chunking Examples** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:983-1012`
   - Added concrete example showing correct multi-chunk splitting
   - Shows exact 100-char boundary format with escaped newlines
   - Warns against single-chunk failure pattern
   - **Expected Impact:** +10-15% AI accuracy

2. **Dynamic Chunk Count Guidance** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:1024-1029`
   - Calculates expected chunks based on batch size
   - Explicitly tells AI: "You MUST create 5-12 chunks"
   - Prevents single-chunk-for-large-text failure
   - **Expected Impact:** Eliminates most single-chunk failures

3. **Early Validation & Detection** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:901-922`
   - Detects when AI returns too few chunks BEFORE matching
   - Validates chunk sizes (flags >12K chunks)
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - **Expected Impact:** Better diagnostics, faster debugging

4. **Enhanced Recovery Strategies** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:557-660`
   - Fuzzy boundary matching (6 variations)
   - Content-based search with position validation
   - Partial boundary matching (50-char fallback)
   - **Expected Impact:** Recovers 80% of boundary failures

5. **Comprehensive Validation Layer** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:373-476`
   - Validates: bounds, size, gaps, content
   - Returns confidence levels (high/medium/low)
   - **Expected Impact:** Catches edge cases

6. **Detailed Reliability Reporting** ✅
   - File: `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts:402-468`
   - Reports: exact matches, recovered, fallbacks, failures
   - High-confidence chunk percentage
   - Boundary truncation rate
   - Overall reliability score
   - **Expected Impact:** Full observability

### Bug Fixes Applied ✅

1. **Removed Log Spam**
   - No more full document logging (was 200KB+ per document)
   - Now shows 500-char previews only

2. **Chunk Deduplication**
   - Removes duplicate chunks from batch overlaps
   - Detects >50% overlap and removes

3. **SINGLE_PASS_THRESHOLD Reduction**
   - 250K → 200K (23% safety margin vs Gemini's 65K token limit)

4. **Parameterized Batch Stitcher**
   - Accepts overlap size parameter (was hardcoded)
   - Progressive substring matching scales with overlap

5. **Boundary Truncation Metrics**
   - Tracks how often AI violates 100-char rule
   - Warns if >10% truncation rate

## Expected Current Performance

With Phase 1 complete:
- **Boundary match rate:** 90-95% (up from ~70-80%)
- **Recovery success:** 80% of failures recovered
- **Overall reliability:** 95-98%
- **Diagnostic visibility:** Excellent

---

## Phase 2: Maximum Reliability (Not Yet Implemented)

### Remaining Work: 4-5 hours total

#### 1. Two-Pass Chunking System (2 hours)

**Concept:** Separate boundary detection from metadata extraction

**Files to Create:**
- `worker/lib/two-pass-chunking.ts` - Framework created, needs integration
- `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts` - Add `useTwoPass` config option

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Pass 1: Boundaries Only** (1 hour)
   ```typescript
   // Simpler prompt = higher accuracy
   const prompt = `Split into chunks. Return ONLY:
   - boundaryBefore (exactly 100 chars)
   - boundaryAfter (exactly 100 chars)
   - content (the chunk text)

   NO metadata yet - just boundaries!`
   ```

2. **Pass 2: Batch Metadata Extraction** (1 hour)
   ```typescript
   // Process 5 chunks at a time
   const metadataPrompt = `For this text: "${chunkContent}"
   Extract: themes, concepts, emotions, domain, summary`

   // Parallel batch processing
   const results = await Promise.all(
     batch.map(chunk => extractMetadata(chunk))
   )
   ```

3. **Integration with existing system**
   - Add config flag: `config.useTwoPass = true`
   - Falls back to single-pass if two-pass fails
   - Same output format as current system

**Expected Impact:**
- **+5-10% boundary accuracy** (focused task)
- **+10-15% metadata quality** (more thorough extraction)
- **Cost:** +40% (1 boundary call + N metadata calls)
- **Time:** +20% (parallel metadata extraction)

**Testing Strategy:**
```typescript
// Compare single-pass vs two-pass
const singlePass = await chunkWithBoundaries(markdown, ai)
const twoPass = await twoPassChunkWithBoundaries(markdown, ai)

// Measure:
// - Match rate difference
// - Metadata quality difference
// - Processing time difference
```

#### 2. Self-Validation Loop (1.5 hours)

**Concept:** AI validates its own output and fixes issues

**Files to Modify:**
- `worker/lib/chunking-simple.ts` - Add validation loop

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **After initial chunking, validate results** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   const issues = validateChunkingResults(chunks, markdown)
   // Returns: [{chunkIndex, problem, severity}]
   ```

2. **Generate targeted correction prompt** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   if (issues.length > 0 && issues.length < 5) {
     const correctionPrompt = `
     You generated chunks with these issues:
     - Chunk 3: Boundary too long (367 chars → must be 100)
     - Chunk 7: Large gap (2500 chars) from previous chunk

     Fix ONLY these chunks. Return corrected versions.
     `
   }
   ```

3. **Apply corrections** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   const corrected = await ai.generateContent(correctionPrompt)
   chunks = mergeCorrections(chunks, corrected)

   // Limit: max 2 correction iterations
   ```

**Expected Impact:**
- **+3-5% reliability** (catches edge cases)
- **Cost:** +20% (only when issues detected)
- **Reduces manual intervention** dramatically

**Edge Cases:**
- If >5 issues: Don't correct, log for review
- If correction fails: Use original chunks
- Max 2 iterations to prevent loops

---

#### 3. Enhanced Cleanup with Self-Correction (1 hour)

**Concept:** Cleanup validates its own output

**Files to Modify:**
- `worker/lib/markdown-cleanup-simple.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Post-cleanup validation** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   const cleaned = await cleanMarkdown(ai, markdown)

   // Check for common cleanup failures
   const issues = validateCleanup(cleaned)
   // - Still has page numbers?
   // - Still has filenames?
   // - Excessive whitespace?
   ```

2. **Targeted re-cleaning** (30 min)
   ```typescript
   if (issues.length > 0) {
     const targetedPrompt = `
     The cleaned text still has these artifacts:
     - Page numbers: 123, 456, 789
     - Filename: Document1.pdf on line 5

     Remove ONLY these specific artifacts.
     `
   }
   ```

**Expected Impact:**
- **+5-10% cleanup quality**
- **Reduces artifact leakage** into chunks

---

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite (30 min)

**Create test documents:**
- Small (10 pages) - fast validation
- Medium (100 pages) - realistic test
- Large (500 pages) - stress test
- Edge cases (technical, narrative, mixed)

**Automated metrics:**
```bash
npm run test:reliability -- <document-id>

# Reports:
# - Match rate: 98.5%
# - Recovery rate: 15.2%
# - Validation warnings: 2
# - Processing time: 12m 34s
# - Cost: $0.58
# - Reliability score: 99.2%
```

## Rollback Plan

If Phase 2 causes issues:

1. **Disable two-pass:**
   ```typescript
   // In chunking-simple.ts
   const useTwoPass = false // Set to false
   ```

2. **Revert to Phase 1:**
   - All Phase 1 improvements remain
   - Still get 95-98% reliability
   - No breaking changes

3. **Debug and retry:**
   - Two-pass is isolated module
   - Can fix without affecting main system

## Questions / Notes

- **Temperature tuning:** Currently 0.0 for boundaries. Might try 0.1-0.2 if too conservative?
- **Model selection:** Using gemini-2.0-flash-exp. Could try gemini-2.0-flash-thinking for complex documents?
- **Batch size optimization:** Currently 25K chars. Might test 20K or 30K for optimal results?
