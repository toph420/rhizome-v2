# Brainstorming Session: Document Processor Stabilization & Fingerprinting Foundation

**Session Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Participants**: Development Team  
**Facilitator**: Assistant  
**Duration**: Extended Analysis Session  
**Focus Area**: Document Processing Pipeline Refactoring & 7-Engine Preparation

---

## 1. Session Context

### Current Situation
The Rhizome V2 document processing pipeline has grown to 800+ lines of monolithic code in `worker/handlers/process-document.ts`, experiencing:
- JSON parsing failures blocking document processing
- No retry logic for Gemini API failures  
- Sequential processing causing performance bottlenecks
- Missing metadata extraction needed for 6 of 7 planned collision detection engines
- Difficult debugging due to code bloat and intermingled responsibilities

### Feature Vision
Implementation of a sophisticated 7-engine parallel collision detection system as detailed in `docs/prps/connection-synthesis-system.md`:
1. Semantic Similarity (pgvector)
2. Thematic Bridges (Jaccard on themes)
3. Structural Isomorphisms (pattern matching)
4. Contradiction Tensions (opposing tones)
5. Emotional Resonance (tone matching)
6. Methodological Echoes (method signatures)
7. Temporal Rhythms (narrative patterns)

### Session Objective
Design a three-week implementation plan that:
1. **Week 1**: Stabilizes current processing (reliability)
2. **Week 2**: Enriches metadata extraction (foundation)
3. **Week 3**: Implements 7-engine system (innovation)

## 2. Requirements Analysis

### User Stories Identified

#### Immediate Needs (Week 1)
- **As a user**, I need documents to process successfully every time, even with API hiccups
- **As a user**, I need large PDFs (50MB+) to process without memory issues
- **As a developer**, I need to debug processing failures quickly without wading through 800 lines

#### Foundation Building (Week 2)  
- **As the system**, I need rich metadata per chunk to enable intelligent connections
- **As a developer**, I need metadata extraction to be extensible for future engines

#### Vision Implementation (Week 3)
- **As a user**, I need to discover non-obvious connections between documents
- **As a user**, I need connections weighted by my personal preferences
- **As the system**, I need to detect 7 types of connections in parallel under 5 seconds

### Technical Requirements

#### Stability Requirements
- Process 100% of valid documents without JSON parse errors
- Retry failed Gemini API calls with exponential backoff
- Cache Gemini file uploads (48-hour TTL) to avoid re-uploads
- Batch database inserts (50+ chunks at once)
- Memory-efficient streaming for large PDFs

#### Metadata Requirements
Each chunk needs:
```typescript
{
  // Current (basic)
  themes: string[]
  importance_score: number
  summary: string
  
  // Required for 7 engines (new)
  structural_patterns: string[]    // "argument", "example", "dialectical"
  emotional_tone: string[]         // "critical", "skeptical", "affirmative"  
  key_concepts: string[]          // Main ideas discussed
  method_signatures: string[]     // "genealogical", "phenomenological"
  narrative_rhythm: {             // Temporal patterns
    pattern: string
    density: number
    momentum: number
  }
}
```

### Business Requirements
- Zero data loss during reprocessing
- Processing status visible in UI at all times
- Backwards compatibility with existing chunks
- Personal preference weights adjustable in real-time (<100ms)

## 3. Solutions Explored

### Architecture Solutions

#### Solution A: Complete Rewrite (Rejected)
- **Pros**: Clean slate, optimal design
- **Cons**: 6+ weeks, risky, abandons working code
- **Decision**: Too risky given current instability

#### Solution B: Gradual Refactoring (Selected) ✅
- **Pros**: Incremental improvements, maintains stability, 3-week timeline
- **Cons**: Some temporary code duplication
- **Decision**: Best balance of speed and safety

#### Solution C: Minimal Patches (Rejected)
- **Pros**: 1 week implementation
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve core issues, blocks future features
- **Decision**: Technical debt would compound

### Technical Implementation Approaches

#### Source Processor Extraction Pattern
```typescript
// worker/processors/base.ts
abstract class SourceProcessor {
  constructor(
    protected ai: GoogleGenAI,
    protected supabase: any,
    protected job: any
  ) {}
  
  abstract process(): Promise<ProcessResult>
  
  protected async withRetry<T>(
    fn: () => Promise<T>,
    options = { maxAttempts: 3, backoff: 'exponential' }
  ): Promise<T> {
    // Shared retry logic
  }
}

// worker/processors/youtube.ts
class YouTubeProcessor extends SourceProcessor {
  async process() {
    const transcript = await this.fetchTranscript()
    const cleaned = await this.cleanWithAI(transcript)
    const chunks = await this.createChunks(cleaned)
    return { markdown: cleaned, chunks }
  }
}
```

#### Gemini Cache Implementation
```typescript
class GeminiFileCache {
  private static cache = new Map<string, CachedFile>()
  
  static async getOrUpload(
    documentId: string,
    fileBuffer: ArrayBuffer
  ): Promise<string> {
    const cached = this.cache.get(documentId)
    if (cached && cached.expiresAt > new Date()) {
      return cached.uri
    }
    
    const uploaded = await this.uploadToGemini(fileBuffer)
    this.cache.set(documentId, {
      uri: uploaded.uri,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 47 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
    })
    return uploaded.uri
  }
}
```

#### Metadata Enrichment Strategy
```typescript
// Single-pass extraction with all metadata
const ENHANCED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `
Extract document with semantic chunks and rich metadata:

For each chunk provide:
1. themes: Specific domain concepts (philosophy, biology, etc.)
2. structural_patterns: [argument|example|dialectical|narrative|comparison]
3. emotional_tone: [critical|affirmative|skeptical|confident|neutral]
4. key_concepts: Main ideas being discussed
5. method_signatures: [analytical|genealogical|phenomenological|empirical]
6. importance_score: 0.0-1.0 centrality to document
7. summary: One sentence description

Return JSON: {
  "markdown": "full document",
  "chunks": [{ ...all fields above... }]
}`
```

## 4. Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Source Processor Architecture
**Choice**: Extract separate processor classes  
**Rationale**: 
- Isolates source-specific logic (YouTube timestamps, PDF pages, etc.)
- Enables parallel development and testing
- Reduces main handler from 800 to ~200 lines
**Impact**: Each source type becomes independently maintainable

### Decision 2: Retry & Caching Strategy  
**Choice**: Implement at Gemini SDK level with 3 retries + 48hr file cache
**Rationale**:
- Gemini failures are transient but common
- Re-uploading PDFs wastes time and quota
- 48-hour cache aligns with Gemini's file expiration
**Impact**: 90% reduction in Gemini-related failures

### Decision 3: Metadata Extraction Approach
**Choice**: Single-pass extraction with enhanced schema
**Rationale**:
- Two-phase would add 5-10s per document
- Gemini 2.0 Flash can handle complex prompts
- All engines need metadata anyway
**Impact**: Enables all 7 engines without reprocessing

### Decision 4: Batching Strategy
**Choice**: 50 chunks per database batch
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL parameter limit is 65535
- 50 chunks × ~20 fields = 1000 parameters (safe margin)
- Reduces database round trips by 98%
**Impact**: 10x faster chunk insertion

### Decision 5: JSON Parsing Approach
**Choice**: Simple parse → repair once → fail fast
**Rationale**:
- Current repair function is 150+ lines of complexity
- Most Gemini responses are valid JSON
- Better to retry than over-engineer repairs
**Impact**: Cleaner code, faster failures, better reliability

## 10. Post-Session Notes

### Key Insights
1. **Foundation First**: The temptation is to jump to the exciting 7-engine system, but without stable processing, those engines have nothing to work with.

2. **Metadata is the Bridge**: Rich metadata extraction in Week 2 is what enables all 7 engines. This wasn't clearly identified in the original PRP but is critical.

3. **Parallel by Default**: Moving from sequential to parallel processing (both in extraction and detection) is the key performance unlock.

4. **Fail Fast Philosophy**: Complex JSON repair was causing more problems than it solved. Simple retry is better.

5. **Cache Everything**: Gemini file uploads are expensive. 48-hour cache aligns perfectly with their expiration.

### Decisions for Future Sessions
- Consider 8th engine for citation networks
- Explore real-time connection detection during reading
- Investigate GPU acceleration for embeddings
- Plan for connection explanation UI ("why these connect")

### Unresolved Questions
- Should we version chunks to support reprocessing?
- How to handle metadata schema evolution?
- When to trigger connection re-detection?
- How to balance storage vs computation for connections?

---

**Session Summary**: We've designed a pragmatic three-week plan that stabilizes the foundation (Week 1), enriches metadata extraction (Week 2), and implements the ambitious 7-engine collision detection system (Week 3). This approach reduces technical debt while building toward the innovative vision in the connection-synthesis PRP.

**Next Steps**: Begin Week 1 implementation tomorrow with source processor extraction. Daily standups to track progress against success criteria.
