# Feature Brainstorming Session: Large Document Processing with Gemini 2.5 Flash

**Date:** 2025-09-28  
**Session Type:** Technical Architecture & Solution Design

## 1. Context & Problem Statement

### Problem Description
Current document processing in Rhizome V2 fails on large documents (books, lengthy PDFs, extensive transcripts) due to Gemini 2.0 Flash's 8,192 output token limit. When processing documents like the Communist Manifesto or full books, the system either truncates content or throws "AI response missing required fields" errors, making the app unusable for its core purpose.

### Target Users
- **Primary Users:** Me (sole user) - need to process entire books and long academic papers for research
- **Secondary Users:** Future self needing to re-process documents with different chunking strategies

### Success Criteria
- **Business Metrics:** 100% of document content extracted verbatim without truncation
- **User Metrics:** Ability to process 500+ page books reliably
- **Technical Metrics:** 
  - Zero data loss during extraction
  - Complete markdown fidelity
  - Semantic chunks with accurate themes/summaries

### Constraints & Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints:** 
  - Gemini API token limits (model-dependent)
  - 1000-page maximum per PDF (Files API limit)
  - 50MB file size limit
- **Business Constraints:** 
  - Higher API costs acceptable for reliability
  - Processing time not critical (can take 10+ minutes)
- **Regulatory/Compliance:** None (personal use)
- **Assumptions Made:** 
  - Verbatim accuracy more important than speed
  - Re-chunking without re-extraction is valuable
  - 65K output tokens sufficient for most extraction segments

## 2. Brainstormed Ideas & Options

### Option A: Multi-Pass Extraction with Gemini 2.0 Flash (Current Approach)
- **Description:** Continue using 2.0 Flash with 8,192 token limit, implement complex chunking logic
- **Key Features:** 
  - Split PDFs with PyPDF2 before upload
  - Multiple extraction calls with overlap validation
  - Stitch markdown segments together
- **Pros:** 
  - Lower cost per API call
  - Existing code mostly works
  - Well-understood model behavior
- **Cons:** 
  - Complex implementation with many failure points
  - Requires external PDF processing library
  - Difficult overlap validation logic
  - Still fails on dense pages
- **Effort Estimate:** L (Large - complex chunking logic)
- **Risk Level:** High (many edge cases)
- **Dependencies:** PyPDF2, complex validation logic

### Option B: Upgrade to Gemini 2.5 Flash with 65K Output Tokens
- **Description:** Use Gemini 2.5 Flash universally for all document types, leveraging 65,535 output token capacity
- **Key Features:** 
  - Single extraction call for documents up to ~200 pages
  - Context caching for re-chunking without re-extraction
  - Simple fallback for >200 page books
- **Pros:** 
  - Dramatically simpler implementation
  - Guaranteed complete extraction
  - No external PDF libraries needed
  - Context caching enables re-processing
  - Works for all document types (PDF, markdown, transcripts)
- **Cons:** 
  - 4x higher cost per API call
  - Requires SDK upgrade
  - Still needs chunking for very large books (>200 pages)
- **Effort Estimate:** M (Medium - straightforward implementation)
- **Risk Level:** Low (proven API, simple logic)
- **Dependencies:** @google/genai v1.21.0 upgrade

### Option C: Hybrid Approach with Document Size Detection
- **Description:** Use 2.0 Flash for small docs, 2.5 Flash for large ones
- **Key Features:** 
  - Page count detection
  - Automatic model selection
  - Optimized costs for small documents
- **Pros:** 
  - Cost optimization for small documents
  - Flexibility in model choice
- **Cons:** 
  - Two code paths to maintain
  - Complexity in routing logic
  - Risk of choosing wrong model
  - More testing required
- **Effort Estimate:** L (Large - dual implementation)
- **Risk Level:** Medium (routing complexity)
- **Dependencies:** Both model implementations

### Additional Ideas Considered
- Batch API for non-urgent processing (24-hour turnaround unacceptable)
- Using multiple smaller models in parallel (too complex)
- Converting to images first (loses text fidelity)
- External OCR services (adds dependencies)

## 3. Decision Outcome

### Chosen Approach
**Selected Solution:** Option B - Upgrade to Gemini 2.5 Flash with 65K Output Tokens

### Rationale
**Primary Factors in Decision:**
- Simplicity wins: One code path for all document types reduces bugs and maintenance
- Verbatim accuracy is paramount: 65K tokens ensures complete extraction without truncation
- Cost is acceptable: As sole user, paying 4x more for reliability is worthwhile
- Future-proof: Re-chunking with context caching enables experimentation
- Universal application: Works for PDFs, long markdown files, and extensive video transcripts

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **What We're Gaining:** 
  - Simple, reliable extraction
  - Complete document fidelity
  - Ability to re-process without re-extraction
  - Unified processing pipeline
- **What We're Sacrificing:** 
  - Higher API costs (~$0.164 per 65K tokens vs $0.039)
  - Need to upgrade SDK dependency
- **Future Considerations:** 
  - Can optimize with Batch API later if costs become concern
  - Context caching reduces costs for repeated processing

## 4. Implementation Plan
