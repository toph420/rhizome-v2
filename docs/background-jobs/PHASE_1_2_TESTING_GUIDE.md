```

**After Phase 1:**
```
‚ö° Processing: The Man Who Sold the World.pdf  ‚óè (green pulse)

- [ ] Job names include modes (e.g., "Smart Mode", "with embeddings")

---

### 2C: Import Job Naming

**Steps:**
1. Admin Panel ‚Üí **Scanner** tab
2. Delete chunks for one document:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM chunks WHERE document_id = '[your-doc-id]';
   ```
3. Admin Panel ‚Üí **Import** tab
4. Select document
5. Check "Regenerate Embeddings"
6. Click "Import"

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Job name shows: **üìä "Import: [Document Title] (with embeddings)"**
- [ ] Icon is a database (üìä) with blue color
- [ ] Green pulsing dot appears
- [ ] Progress details show: "Updated X of Y chunk embeddings"

---

### 2D: Connections Job Naming

**Steps:**
1. Admin Panel ‚Üí **Connections** tab
2. Select a document
3. Select mode: "Smart Mode"
4. Enable "Preserve user-validated connections"
5. Click "Start Reprocessing"

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Job name shows: **üåê "Connections: [Document Title] (Smart Mode)"**
- [ ] Icon is a network (üåê) with orange color
- [ ] Green pulsing dot appears

---

## Test 3: Visual Heartbeat Indicator (Phase 1)

### 3A: Active Job - Pulse Visible

**Steps:**
1. Start processing a document
2. Watch ProcessingDock continuously for 30 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] **Green dot pulses** next to job name
- [ ] Pulse is smooth and visible (animate-pulse CSS class)
- [ ] Pulse indicates job updated within last 10 seconds

**Implementation Check:**
```tsx
// In ProcessingDock.tsx
const isAlive = Date.now() - (job.updatedAt || job.createdAt) < 10000
{isAlive && <div className="h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-green-500 animate-pulse" />}
```

---

### 3B: Stuck Job - No Pulse

**Test Scenario**: Simulate stuck job (worker stopped)

**Steps:**
1. Start processing a document
2. Stop the worker: `Ctrl+C` in worker terminal
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Check ProcessingDock

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Green pulse **disappears** after 10 seconds (job not updating)
- [ ] Progress bar remains at last value (e.g., 65%)
- [ ] Job still shows but with no heartbeat indicator
- [ ] User can identify job is stuck

---

## Test 4: Progress Updates (Phase 2)

### 4A: Heartbeat Mechanism

**Steps:**
1. Start worker in one terminal
2. Tail worker logs in another:
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/worker.log | grep -E "(Heartbeat|Stage)"
   ```
3. Upload a document

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Worker logs show: `[Heartbeat] Started`
- [ ] Heartbeat updates appear every 5 seconds
- [ ] Worker logs show: `[Heartbeat] Stopped` when done
- [ ] Database `background_jobs.updated_at` changes every 5 seconds

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT id, status, updated_at, created_at,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - updated_at)) as seconds_since_update
FROM background_jobs
WHERE status = 'processing'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected: `seconds_since_update` < 10 seconds while processing

---

### 4B: Micro-Progress During Chunking

**Steps:**
1. Process a document with 200+ pages (will generate 300+ chunks)
2. Watch ProcessingDock during the **65-85% range** (chunking/embedding stage)

**Expected Results - Before Phase 2:**
```
Progress stuck at 65% for 5-15 minutes
Details: "Generating embeddings for 0 chunks"
User uncertain if job is frozen
```

**Expected Results - After Phase 2:**
```
70%: "Generating embeddings for 234 chunks..."
75%: "Generated 117 embeddings (50%)"
80%: "Generated 234 embeddings"
82%: "Preparing 234 chunks for database"
85%: "Inserting 234 chunks into database"
90%: "Saved 234 chunks successfully"
```

- [ ] Progress updates every 5-10 seconds during chunking
- [ ] Details text changes to show current operation
- [ ] Green pulse confirms job is alive
- [ ] User confident processing is happening

---

### 4C: Micro-Progress During Import

**Steps:**
1. Import a document with 300+ chunks
2. Enable "Regenerate Embeddings"
3. Watch progress during 65-90% range

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Progress updates every ~10 chunks
- [ ] Details show: "Updated 130 of 500 chunk embeddings"
- [ ] Progress bar increments smoothly (not stuck)
- [ ] Heartbeat pulse visible throughout

**Worker Logs Check:**
```bash
tail -f /tmp/worker.log | grep "Embedding batch"
```

Should see:
```
Embedding batch 1/10: 50 chunks processed
Embedding batch 2/10: 100 chunks processed
...
```

---

### 4D: Merge Smart Micro-Progress

**Steps:**
1. Create annotations on 3 chunks
2. Modify chunk metadata to create conflict
3. Import with "Merge Smart" strategy

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Progress shows: "Updated 50 of 300 chunk metadata"
- [ ] Updates appear every 10 chunks
- [ ] Annotations remain intact after import

---

## Test 5: All Job Types Display

### 5A: detect_connections Job

**Steps:**
1. Process a document (will queue detect_connections job automatically)
2. Check ProcessingDock and Jobs tab

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Job type shows: **üîÄ "Detecting: [Document Title]"**
- [ ] Icon is git-branch (üîÄ) with pink color
- [ ] Job appears in both ProcessingDock and Jobs tab
- [ ] No "unmapped" or undefined labels

---

### 5B: Export Job

**Steps:**
1. Admin Panel ‚Üí **Export** tab
2. Select 3 documents
3. Check "Include Connections" + "Include Annotations"
4. Click "Export Selected (3)"

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Job name: **üìÑ "Export: 3 documents (with connections)"**
- [ ] Icon is file-text (üìÑ) with purple color
- [ ] Progress shows per-document status
- [ ] Details show: "Processing document 2 of 3"

---

## Test 6: Console Error Check

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
2. Perform all above tests
3. Check for errors

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] **No React errors** related to JobList or ProcessingDock
- [ ] **No TypeScript errors** in console
- [ ] **No 404 errors** in Network tab
- [ ] Console shows job updates:
  ```
  [BackgroundJobs] Registering job: abc123 (process_document)
  [BackgroundJobs] Auto-starting polling
  [BackgroundJobs] Job completed: abc123
  ```

---

## Test 7: Edge Cases

### 7A: Multiple Active Jobs

**Steps:**
1. Start 3 jobs simultaneously:
   - Process document A
   - Import document B (with embeddings)
   - Reprocess connections for document C

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All 3 jobs appear in ProcessingDock
- [ ] Each has unique icon and color
- [ ] All show green pulse (alive)
- [ ] Progress updates independently
- [ ] No UI slowdown or flickering

---

### 7B: Failed Job (No Pulse)

**Steps:**
1. Cause a job to fail (e.g., invalid PDF)
2. Check ProcessingDock after failure

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Job status changes to "failed"
- [ ] Green pulse **disappears** (no updates)
- [ ] Red error icon appears
- [ ] Error message visible in details

---

## Test 8: Performance Check

**Steps:**
1. Process a large document (500 pages, 700+ chunks)
2. Monitor browser performance (DevTools ‚Üí Performance tab)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] UI remains responsive during processing
- [ ] Progress updates don't cause lag
- [ ] Polling every 2 seconds doesn't spike CPU
- [ ] Memory usage stable (no leaks)

**Browser Performance Metrics:**
- CPU usage: < 10% while idle (polling active)
- Memory: < 50MB increase during processing
- Frame rate: 60 FPS maintained
