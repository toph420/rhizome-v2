  ✅ Completed: T-001 - Python Wrapper

Created: worker/scripts/chonkie_chunk.py (200 lines)

Features:
- ✅ All 9 chunker types supported (token, sentence, recursive, semantic, late,
  code, neural, slumber, table)
- ✅ stdin/stdout JSON IPC pattern (matches existing scripts)
- ✅ sys.stdout.flush() after output (prevents IPC hangs)
- ✅ Proper RecursiveLevel initialization (fixed from PRP example)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with stack traces
- ✅ Character offset guarantee (start_index, end_index)
- ✅ Tested and working with recursive chunker

Key Patterns Followed:
- Based on docling_extract.py and extract_metadata_pydantic.py
- Proper exception handling to stderr
- Clean JSON output to stdout
- No mixing of logging and data output

Test Result:
[{"text": "# Chapter 1\n\nFirst paragraph...", "start_index": 0, "end_index": 81,
"token_count": 18, "chunker_type": "recursive"}]

   - All tests passing ✓

Functions Implemented

✅ hasOverlap() - Detects chunk overlap via character offsets
- Pattern from bulletproof-matcher.ts (lines 867)
- Handles all overlap scenarios (before, after, partial, complete)

✅ calculateOverlapPercentage() - Confidence scoring metric
- Returns 0.0-1.0 percentage of Chonkie chunk covered by Docling
- Used for high/medium/low confidence thresholds

✅ aggregateMetadata() - Combines multiple Docling chunks
- Union of heading paths (unique headings)
- Earliest to latest page range
- Concatenates all bounding boxes
- First non-null section marker (EPUBs)

✅ calculateConfidence() - High/medium/low scoring
- High: 3+ overlaps OR >70% coverage
- Medium: 1-2 overlaps with >30% coverage
- Low: <30% coverage OR no overlaps (interpolated)

✅ interpolateMetadata() - Handles no-overlap cases
- Finds nearest Docling chunk before/after Chonkie chunk
- Copies metadata from nearest neighbor
- Marks as interpolated for user validation
- Expected usage: <10% of chunks

✅ transferMetadataToChonkieChunks() - Main orchestrator
- Processes all Chonkie chunks
- Finds overlapping Docling chunks for each
- Aggregates metadata from overlaps
- Calculates confidence scores
- Returns ProcessedChunk[] ready for database

Test Results

All 5 test modules passing:
- ✓ hasOverlap: 5/5 tests pass
- ✓ calculateOverlapPercentage: 4/4 tests pass
- ✓ aggregateMetadata: 3/3 tests pass
- ✓ calculateConfidence: 5/5 tests pass
- ✓ transferMetadataToChonkieChunks: Integration test complete

Test Output:
Overlap coverage: 100.0% (2/2 chunks)
Average overlaps per chunk: 1.50
Interpolated chunks: 0 (0.0%)

Key Features

✅ Overlap Detection
- Reuses bulletproof matcher logic (lines 862-891)
- Handles all edge cases (before, after, partial, complete)
- Multiple overlaps expected and beneficial

✅ Metadata Aggregation
- Union of heading paths from all overlapping chunks
- Page range (earliest to latest)
- Bounding box concatenation for citation support
- Section markers for EPUB support

✅ Confidence Scoring
- Based on overlap count and percentage
- High/medium/low thresholds from PRP specification
- Surfaces low-confidence chunks for user review

✅ Interpolation Fallback
- Handles rare no-overlap cases (<10% expected)
- Uses nearest neighbor metadata
- Marks for user validation in ChunkQualityPanel

✅ Statistics & Monitoring
- Tracks overlap coverage (target: 70-90%)
- Warns if coverage <70% (indicates matching issues)
- Logs average overlaps per chunk
- Counts interpolated chunks

Patterns followed:
- worker/lib/local/bulletproof-matcher.ts - Overlap detection (lines 862-891)
- docs/prps/chonkie-integration.md - Metadata transfer spec (lines 606-916)
- Existing types in worker/lib/chonkie/types.ts

✅ T-004 Complete: Database Migration

Created: supabase/migrations/050_add_chunker_type.sql (61 lines)

Schema Changes Applied
1. Chunks Table (4 new columns + 4 indexes):
- chunker_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'hybrid' - Tracks which Chonkie strategy was
  used
- metadata_overlap_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 - Number of Docling chunks that
  overlapped
- metadata_confidence TEXT DEFAULT 'high' - Quality score (high/medium/low)
- metadata_interpolated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false - True if no overlaps found

Indexes:
- idx_chunks_chunker_type - Query by chunker strategy
- idx_chunks_doc_chunker - Document + chunker composite
- idx_chunks_metadata_confidence - Filter by confidence
- idx_chunks_interpolated - Find interpolated chunks only
1. Documents Table (1 new column + 1 index):
- chunker_type TEXT DEFAULT 'recursive' - User-selected strategy per document
- idx_documents_chunker_type - Query documents by chunker
1. User Preferences Table (1 new column):
- default_chunker_type TEXT DEFAULT 'recursive' - User's default preference

CHECK Constraints

All three tables enforce valid chunker types:
CHECK (chunker_type IN (
'hybrid', 'token', 'sentence', 'recursive', 'semantic',
'late', 'code', 'neural', 'slumber', 'table'
))

Metadata confidence enforcement:
CHECK (metadata_confidence IN ('high', 'medium', 'low'))

Comments Added

All 6 new columns have descriptive comments for database documentation:
- Explains purpose of each field
- Documents confidence scoring logic
- Clarifies interpolation behavior
- Notes default values

Migration Validation

✅ Applied cleanly via npx supabase db reset
✅ All 50 migrations applied successfully
✅ All columns created with correct types and defaults
✅ All indexes created successfully
✅ All CHECK constraints active
✅ All comments present in schema

Key Features

Backward Compatibility:
- Default chunker_type = 'hybrid' maintains existing behavior
- Existing chunks will show 'hybrid' (old HybridChunker)
- New chunks will show actual Chonkie strategy used

Metadata Quality Tracking:
- metadata_overlap_count enables quality monitoring
- metadata_confidence surfaces low-quality chunks for review
- metadata_interpolated flags chunks needing validation

User Control:
- Documents can specify chunker per upload
- User preferences store default choice
- Indexes enable efficient filtering by strategy

✅ T-005 Complete: Update TypeScript Database Types

 ✅ T-006 Complete: Remove Inline Metadata System

  I've successfully completed Task T-006 from the Chonkie Integration project.
  Here's what was accomplished:

  Files Deleted

  - ✅ worker/lib/local/inline-metadata-parser.ts (198 lines removed)
  - ✅ worker/scripts/__pycache__/inline_metadata_serializer.cpython-313.pyc
  (Python cache cleaned)

  Files Modified

  pdf-processor.ts (~120 lines removed):
  - Removed inline metadata import (lines 41-47)
  - Removed useInlineMetadata variable and chunk size logic (lines 82-89)
  - Removed inline metadata options from extractPdfBuffer call (lines 103-106)
  - Removed Stage 2.5 (inline metadata parsing stage, lines 160-187)
  - Removed large if (parsedInlineChunks) conversion block (lines 330-392, ~62
  lines)

  docling-extractor.ts:
  - Removed inline_metadata property from interface
  - Removed inline metadata option from pythonOptions

  docling_extract.py:
  - Removed inline metadata from docstring
  - Removed use_inline_metadata variable
  - Removed HTML comment marker generation logic
  - Removed inline metadata conditional markdown generation
  - Removed inline_metadata from return statement
  - Updated comment to remove inline metadata reference

  Validation Results

  ✅ TypeScript Compilation: No inline metadata-related errors✅ Code References:
  No inline metadata references remain in codebase✅ Import Cleanup: No orphaned
  imports✅ Net Code Reduction: ~120 lines removed from pdf-processor.ts alone

  Key Changes

  The pipeline is now simplified - no more experimental inline metadata path. The
  system now has a cleaner architecture with:
  - ONE bulletproof matching path (LOCAL mode)
  - ONE cloud chunking path (CLOUD mode)
  - No parallel branching for inline metadata

  This cleanup prepares the codebase for T-007 (Remove Bulletproof-As-Chunking
  System) and eventually the Chonkie integration.

  ✅ T-008 Complete: Remove Cloud Chunking Path

  Successfully removed the CLOUD mode chunking path from both processors! Here's
  the summary:

  Files Modified

  pdf-processor.ts:
  - ✅ Removed CLOUD mode chunking block (lines 610-692, ~83 lines)
  - ✅ Removed orphaned batchChunkAndExtractMetadata import
  - ✅ New line count: 693 lines (down from 776 lines)
  - ✅ Reduction: 83 lines

  epub-processor.ts:
  - ✅ Removed CLOUD mode chunking block (lines 720-802, ~83 lines)
  - ✅ Removed orphaned batchChunkAndExtractMetadata import
  - ✅ New line count: 810 lines (down from ~893 lines)
  - ✅ Reduction: 83 lines

  Validation Results

  CLOUD Mode Removal:
  grep -n "processingMode === 'cloud'" worker/processors/*.ts
  # Result: No matches found ✓

  Orphaned Imports:
  grep -n "batchChunkAndExtractMetadata" worker/processors/*.ts
  # Result: No matches found ✓

  TypeScript Compilation:
  - ✅ No errors in processor files
  - ✅ All existing errors are unrelated (pre-existing test/benchmark issues)

  Total Code Reduction Summary (T-006 + T-007 + T-008)

  T-006 (Inline Metadata): ~120 lines removedT-007 (Bulletproof as Chunking):
  Already done (0 lines, was cleaned up earlier)T-008 (Cloud Chunking): 166 lines
  removed (83 from each processor)

  Net Reduction: ~286 lines removed total

  Architecture Simplification Achieved

  BEFORE (3 parallel paths):
  - ❌ Inline metadata (experimental, PDF only)
  - ❌ Bulletproof matching AS chunking system
  - ❌ Cloud chunking (Gemini semantic)

  AFTER (unified path ready for Chonkie):

  - Interpolation for no-overlap cases (<10% expected)
  - Statistics logging (overlap coverage, avg overlaps, interpolated count)


✅ T-011 COMPLETE: Chunker Selection UI Integration

  Successfully implemented the chunker selection interface for the Chonkie
  Integration project!

  🎯 Changes Made

  1. Created Frontend Types (src/types/chunker.ts):
  - ChunkerType enum matching worker types
  - chunkerDescriptions - User-friendly descriptions for each strategy

  - Table - Markdown tables (3-5 min)

  User Guidance:
  - Description shown below dropdown for selected strategy
  - Time estimate alert appears for non-default strategies
  - Special warning for slumber (very slow)
  - Info icon next to "Chunking Strategy" label

  ✅ Validation Results

  Type Checking: ✅ PASSED
  - No new TypeScript errors introduced
  - All pre-existing errors unrelated to T-011

  Code Quality:
  - Clean integration with existing upload flow

  📋 Next Steps

  T-012: Update ChunkQualityPanel for metadata confidence display
  T-013: Add chunker display to document metadata
  T-014: Integration testing with actual documents
  T-015: Performance benchmarking

    📋 Next Steps

  T-012: Update ChunkQualityPanel for metadata confidence display
  T-013: Add chunker display to document metadata
  T-014: Integration testing with actual documents
  T-015: Performance benchmarking

  🚀 Testing Recommendations

  Once the dev server is running, you can test the chunker selection by:
  1. Navigate to library and click upload
  2. Select a PDF file
  3. Verify chunker dropdown appears with "Recursive" pre-selected
  4. Try selecting different strategies and observe:
    - Description text updates
    - Time estimate alert appears (except for recursive)
    - Special warning for slumber
  5. Upload a document and verify chunkerStrategy appears in job's input_data

  The worker is already configured to receive and use the chunkerStrategy from
  T-010 integration, so the full pipeline should work once a document is uploaded!

  Chonkie Integration Bug Fixes

  Completed Work

  🐛 Bug Fix #1: ReferenceError in Chonkie Chunker

  Problem: ReferenceError: startTime is not defined on line 202 of
  chonkie-chunker.ts

  Root Cause: Variable scope issue - startTime was defined in chunkWithChonkie()
  but referenced in nested runChonkieScript() function.

  Solution:
  - ✅ Added startTime: number parameter to runChonkieScript() function signature
  - ✅ Passed startTime from chunkWithChonkie() call (line 123)
  - ✅ Updated JSDoc documentation

  Files Modified: worker/lib/chonkie/chonkie-chunker.ts

  ---
  🐛 Bug Fix #2: Database Schema Mismatch

  Problem: Could not find the 'token_count' column of 'chunks' in the schema cache

  Root Cause: Migration 050 was missing the token_count column that Chonkie chunks
  require.

  Solution:
  1. Migration 050 Updated (supabase/migrations/050_add_chunker_type.sql):
    - ✅ Added token_count INTEGER column to chunks table
    - ✅ Added comment documenting the column
    - ✅ Applied migration successfully via npx supabase db reset
  2. Database Types Updated (worker/types/database.ts):
    - ✅ Added token_count: number | null to Chunk interface
    - ✅ Added token_count?: number | null to ChunkInsert interface
    - ✅ Added token_count?: number | null to ChunkUpdate interface
  3. Type Fix (worker/lib/chonkie/types.ts):
    - ✅ Fixed typo: ChonkerType → ChunkerType (line 215)

  ---
  🎯 Pipeline Verification

  The complete 10-stage Chonkie pipeline is now fully operational:

  ✅ Stage 1-3: Download → Docling Extract → Cleanup✅ Stage 4 (70-72%):
  Bulletproof matcher as coordinate mapper✅ Stage 5 (72%): Review checkpoint
  (optional)✅ Stage 6 (72-75%): Chonkie chunking (13 chunks in 2s with recursive
  strategy)✅ Stage 7 (75-77%): Metadata transfer (100% overlap coverage, 2.31 avg
  overlaps/chunk)✅ Stage 8 (77-90%): Metadata enrichment (PydanticAI + Ollama)✅
  Stage 9 (90-95%): Embeddings generation (Transformers.js, 768d)✅ Stage 10
  (95-100%): Finalize and save to database ← NOW WORKS!

  ---
  📊 Key Metrics from Test Run

  - Chunker Strategy: Recursive (default, recommended)
  - Chunks Created: 13 chunks
  - Processing Time: 2 seconds (Chonkie stage)
  - Overlap Coverage: 100.0% (13/13 chunks had Docling overlaps)

  🚀 Next Steps

  The chunker display is now fully integrated! When users open a document:
  1. Document header shows the chunker strategy as a colored badge
  2. Hovering over the badge reveals the full strategy description
  3. Color coding provides quick visual identification
  4. Different strategies have distinct appearances (recursive is green, semantic
  is blue, etc.)

  Ready for: End-to-end testing with documents processed using different chunker
  strategies to verify the display updates correctly!
