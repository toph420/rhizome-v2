- **Total Tasks**: 20 tasks across 5 phases
- **Critical Path Duration**: 14-18 hours
- **Recommended Team Size**: 2-3 developers (1 backend, 1 database, 1 QA)
- **Parallel Work Streams**: 3 (Database, Fuzzy Matching, AI Cleaning can run simultaneously)

### Value Delivered
- Clean, readable transcripts without timestamp noise
- Complete metadata for search and UI features (badges, importance indicators)
- Precise chunk positioning enabling Phase 2 annotation system
- Graceful degradation ensuring zero data loss

### 🎯 Current Status (Updated 2025-09-28)
- **Phase 1 (Database Foundation)**: ✅ Complete (T1-T3)

- ✅ Added descriptive column comments

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** database developer  
**I need** to add `position_context` JSONB column and verify `word_count` exists  
**So that** fuzzy matching metadata can be stored alongside chunks

**Files to Create**:
```
└── supabase/migrations/012_youtube_position_context.sql - Add columns and indexes
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create migration file with `ALTER TABLE` statements
2. Add `position_context` JSONB column
3. Check and add `word_count` INTEGER column if missing
4. Create GIN index on `position_context` for JSONB queries
5. Create functional indexes on confidence and method fields
6. Add helpful column comments for documentation

**Code Pattern Reference**:
- Similar pattern: `supabase/migrations/011_*.sql` - Follow existing migration format
- Index creation: Check existing indexes on `chunks` table for naming conventions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Migration file is syntactically correct
  Given the migration SQL file is created
  When I run `npx supabase db reset`
  Then the migration should apply without errors
  And the database should report migration 012 as applied

Scenario 2: Columns are added correctly
  Given the migration has been applied
  When I query the chunks table schema
  Then `position_context` column should exist with JSONB type
  And `word_count` column should exist with INTEGER type

Scenario 3: Indexes are created for query optimization
  Given the migration has been applied
  When I query pg_indexes for chunks table
  Then idx_chunks_position_confidence should exist
  And idx_chunks_position_method should exist
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Create and apply migration
npx supabase db reset

# Verify columns exist
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'chunks' AND column_name IN ('position_context', 'word_count');"

# Verify indexes
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'chunks' AND indexname LIKE '%position%';"
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Migration file created in correct directory
- [x] SQL syntax validated (no errors on dry run)
- [x] `position_context` JSONB column added with comment
- [x] `word_count` INTEGER column verified or added

  Given all Supabase services are stopped
  When I run `npx supabase db reset`
  Then the command should complete with exit code 0
  And migration 012 should be listed as applied

Scenario 2: Database is accessible after reset
  Given the migration has been applied
  When I connect to the database
  Then I should be able to query the chunks table
  And no connection errors should occur
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Stop services
npm run stop

# Apply migration
npx supabase db reset

# Check migration status
npx supabase migration list

# Test database connection
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT 1;"
```

**Definition of Done**:

#### T3: Verify Schema Changes ✅ COMPLETE

**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 hours  
**Dependencies**: T2  
**Assignable To**: Database Developer  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-09-27)

**Completion Notes**:
- ✅ Verified columns exist with correct data types via SQL queries
- ✅ Confirmed indexes created: `idx_chunks_position_confidence`, `idx_chunks_position_method`
- ✅ Tested JSONB query performance - indexes working correctly
- ✅ Column comments verified and descriptive

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** QA engineer  
**I need** to verify the schema changes are correct and indexes are performant  
**So that** the database is ready for implementation

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Query `information_schema.columns` to verify columns exist
2. Check column data types match specification
3. Verify indexes exist and are of correct type
4. Test JSONB query performance on `position_context`
5. Ensure comments are added to columns
6. Document schema changes in technical notes

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Schema matches specification exactly
  Given the migration has been applied
  When I describe the chunks table
  Then position_context should be JSONB type
  And word_count should be INTEGER type
  And both columns should allow NULL values

Scenario 2: Indexes enable fast queries
  Given the indexes are created
  When I EXPLAIN a query filtering by position_context->>'confidence'
  Then the query plan should use idx_chunks_position_confidence
  And index scan should be preferred over sequential scan

Scenario 3: Column comments are informative
  Given the migration includes comments
  When I query pg_description for chunks columns
  Then position_context should have a descriptive comment
  And word_count should have a descriptive comment
```

**Validation Commands**:
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'chunks' 
  AND column_name IN ('position_context', 'word_count');

-- Check indexes exist
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'chunks' 
  AND indexname LIKE '%position%';

-- Test JSONB query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM chunks 
WHERE (position_context->>'confidence')::float >= 0.7;

-- Check column comments
SELECT col_description('chunks'::regclass, ordinal_position) as comment, column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'chunks' 
  AND column_name IN ('position_context', 'word_count');
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Columns exist with correct data types
- [x] Indexes created and accessible
- [x] Query plans show index usage
- [x] Column comments are descriptive
- [x] Schema documentation updated
- [x] No performance warnings from EXPLAIN ANALYZE

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour  
**Dependencies**: T1 (schema defined)  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-09-27)

**Completion Notes**:
- ✅ 3-tier algorithm designed: Exact (1.0) → Trigram Fuzzy (0.75-0.99) → Approximate (0.3)
- ✅ Trigram generation strategy defined (3-char sliding window)
- ✅ Jaccard similarity calculation for fuzzy matching
- ✅ Sliding window with 10% stride (20% for >100 windows)
- ✅ Context extraction (±100 chars, ~5 words)
- ✅ All thresholds documented with rationale

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to design a 3-tier matching algorithm (exact → trigram → approximate)  
**So that** chunk positions can be calculated with confidence scores

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Document algorithm tiers and their confidence thresholds
2. Define trigram generation strategy (3-character sliding window)
3. Design Jaccard similarity calculation for trigram matching
4. Plan sliding window search with 10% stride
5. Define approximate fallback using proportional positioning
6. Document context extraction (first/last 5 words)

**Technical Constraints**:
- Trigram threshold: 0.75 (balanced accuracy/recall)
- Minimum confidence to store: 0.3
- Stride: 10% of chunk length (performance vs accuracy)
- Context window: ±100 characters (typically 5 words)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Algorithm handles all matching scenarios
  Given a chunk and source markdown
  When the algorithm processes the input
  Then it should attempt exact match first
  And fall back to trigram fuzzy match if exact fails
  And use approximate position if fuzzy fails
  And always return a result with confidence score

Scenario 2: Performance is acceptable for typical videos
  Given 50 chunks and 50KB source markdown
  When fuzzy matching runs for all chunks
  Then total processing time should be <5 seconds
  And memory usage should stay <100MB
```

**Design Deliverables**:
- [ ] Algorithm pseudocode documented in PRP
- [ ] Threshold values justified with rationale
- [ ] Performance characteristics estimated
- [ ] Edge cases identified and documented

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Algorithm design documented
- [x] Thresholds and constants defined
- [x] Performance targets set

**So that** chunks can be accurately positioned in source markdown

**Files to Create**:
```
└── worker/lib/fuzzy-matching.ts - Core fuzzy matching implementation (~250 lines)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `FuzzyMatchResult` interface with confidence, offsets, context
2. Implement `fuzzyMatchChunkToSource()` main function
3. Add Tier 1: Exact string match with early return
4. Add Tier 2: Trigram fuzzy matching with sliding window
5. Add Tier 3: Approximate position fallback
6. Implement `generateTrigrams()` helper function
7. Implement `calculateTrigramSimilarity()` using Jaccard index

- Similar pattern: `worker/lib/embeddings.ts` - Module structure and error handling
- JSDoc format: `worker/lib/youtube.ts` - Documentation style
- Type safety: Use strict TypeScript types, no `any`

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Exact match returns 1.0 confidence
  Given a chunk that exists verbatim in source
  When fuzzyMatchChunkToSource is called
  Then confidence should be 1.0
  And method should be 'exact'
  And offsets should point to exact location

Scenario 2: Fuzzy match handles minor variations
  Given a chunk with slight AI reformatting
  When fuzzyMatchChunkToSource is called with 0.75 threshold
  Then confidence should be between 0.75 and 0.99
  And method should be 'fuzzy'
  And offsets should be within chunk length of true position

Scenario 3: Approximate fallback prevents null results
  Given a chunk that doesn't match at all
  When fuzzyMatchChunkToSource is called
  Then confidence should be 0.3
  And method should be 'approximate'
  And offsets should be proportionally positioned
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash

### Phase 3: AI Cleaning Module

---

#### T8: Implement YouTube Cleaning Function

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours  
**Dependencies**: T1 (schema defined)  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to implement AI-powered transcript cleaning with graceful degradation  
**So that** YouTube transcripts are readable without timestamp noise

**Files to Create**:
```
└── worker/lib/youtube-cleaning.ts - AI cleaning with fallback (~120 lines)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `CleaningResult` interface (cleaned, success, error)
2. Implement `cleanYoutubeTranscript()` async function
3. Add Gemini API call with natural language prompt
4. Implement empty response check with fallback
5. Add length sanity check (0.5x-1.5x original length)
6. Implement graceful error handling (always return original on failure)
7. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
8. Define `YOUTUBE_CLEANING_PROMPT` constant

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
Transform this YouTube transcript into clean, readable markdown with semantic section headings.

Requirements:
- Remove filler words (um, uh, you know, like) and fix grammar
- Combine sentence fragments into complete thoughts
- Add descriptive section headings (##) every 3-5 minutes of content
- Remove ALL timestamp links in format [[MM:SS](url)] from the content
- Preserve the natural flow and meaning of the original speech
- Maintain paragraph breaks for readability

Return only the cleaned markdown text. Do not add any preamble or explanation.
```

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:593-643` - Gemini API usage
- Error handling: `worker/lib/youtube.ts` - Graceful degradation pattern

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Successful cleaning removes timestamps
  Given raw markdown with timestamp links
  When cleanYoutubeTranscript is called
  Then cleaned text should not contain [[MM:SS](url)] patterns
  And success should be true
  And error should be undefined

Scenario 2: Graceful degradation on AI failure
  Given Gemini API returns error
  When cleanYoutubeTranscript is called
  Then cleaned should equal original rawMarkdown
  And success should be false
  And error should contain descriptive message

Scenario 3: Length sanity check prevents bad output
  Given AI returns text <50% or >150% original length
  When cleanYoutubeTranscript validates response
  Then cleaned should equal original rawMarkdown
  And success should be false
  And error should mention "Suspicious length change"
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Type check
npm run build

# Run unit tests (after T9)
npm test youtube-cleaning.test.ts

# Lint JSDoc
npm run lint
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] CleaningResult interface defined
- [ ] cleanYoutubeTranscript function implemented
- [ ] Gemini API integration working
- [ ] Empty response fallback tested
- [ ] Length sanity check implemented
- [ ] Error handling returns original markdown

- Graceful degradation: Empty response, API exception, suspicious length
- Edge cases: Very short transcripts, special characters

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/__tests__/embeddings.test.ts` - Mock setup

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: All test suites pass
  Given the YouTube cleaning implementation is complete
  When I run `npm test youtube-cleaning.test.ts`
  Then all 8+ test cases should pass
  And test coverage should be >85% for youtube-cleaning.ts

Scenario 2: Graceful degradation always returns usable output
  Given AI failures (empty, error, bad length)
  When cleaning is attempted
  Then success should be false for all failures
  And cleaned should always equal original markdown
  And error messages should be descriptive

Scenario 3: No exceptions escape function
  Given any error condition
  When cleanYoutubeTranscript is called
  Then no exceptions should be thrown
  And result should always have cleaned text
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Run cleaning tests only
npm test youtube-cleaning.test.ts

# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage youtube-cleaning.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose youtube-cleaning.test.ts
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] 8+ test cases implemented
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Graceful degradation verified for all error types
- [ ] Mock AI client works correctly
- [ ] Test coverage >85% for youtube-cleaning.ts
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections

#### T10: Tune AI Cleaning Prompt

**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour  
**Dependencies**: T9  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to optimize the AI cleaning prompt for best results  
**So that** transcript quality is maximized across different video types

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Test prompt with 5 different video types (tech, tutorial, interview, lecture, casual)
2. Evaluate cleaning quality on timestamp removal, grammar, headings
3. Adjust prompt wording for better results
4. Test temperature values (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) for consistency
5. Add examples to prompt if needed (few-shot prompting)
6. Document prompt tuning decisions

**Quality Metrics**:
- Timestamp removal: 100% (all [[MM:SS](url)] gone)
- Grammar improvement: Subjective (manually verify)
- Heading quality: 1 heading per 3-5 minutes content
- Semantic preservation: >99% (no information loss)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Prompt produces consistent results
  Given 5 different video transcripts
  When cleanYoutubeTranscript processes each one
  Then all should have timestamps removed
  And all should have semantic headings
  And filler words should be reduced significantly

Scenario 2: Temperature setting balances consistency and quality
  Given the same transcript processed 3 times
  When using optimal temperature
  Then results should be similar (>80% text similarity)
  And quality should be consistently high
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Manual testing with real videos
npm run dev

# Upload test videos and review cleaning quality
# Compare source-raw.txt vs content.md
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] 5 different video types tested
- [ ] Prompt optimized for best results
- [ ] Temperature value selected (likely 0.3)
- [ ] Timestamp removal verified at 100%
- [ ] Heading generation appropriate
- [ ] Prompt tuning decisions documented

#### T12: Integrate AI Cleaning into YouTube Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours  
**Dependencies**: T8, T11  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-09-27)

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to integrate AI cleaning into the YouTube processing pipeline  
**So that** transcripts are cleaned before chunking

**Files to Modify**:
```
└── worker/handlers/process-document.ts - Modify YouTube case (lines 67-96)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Import `cleanYoutubeTranscript` from `youtube-cleaning.ts`
2. Add step after `formatTranscriptToMarkdown` to save `source-raw.txt`
3. Add progress update: "Saving original transcript"
4. Call `cleanYoutubeTranscript(ai, markdown)`
5. Handle cleaning result: Update markdown if success, log warning if failure
6. Add progress update: "Transcript cleaned successfully" or warning message
7. Ensure uncleaned markdown is used on failure (graceful degradation)

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:67-96` - YouTube case structure
- Progress updates: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:updateProgress` calls

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Successful cleaning updates markdown
  Given AI cleaning returns success: true
  When YouTube processing runs
  Then markdown should be replaced with cleaned version
  And progress should show "Transcript cleaned successfully"
  And source-raw.txt should be saved to storage

Scenario 2: Failed cleaning uses original markdown
  Given AI cleaning returns success: false
  When YouTube processing runs
  Then markdown should remain unchanged (original)
  And progress should show warning message with error
  And processing should continue without failure

Scenario 3: Source backup is always saved
  Given any cleaning outcome
  When YouTube processing runs
  Then source-raw.txt should exist in storage
  And it should contain original markdown with timestamps
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Type check
npm run build

# Integration test (after T16)
npm test youtube-metadata-enhancement.test.ts

# Manual test
npm run dev
# Upload YouTube video and verify processing
```

**Completion Notes**:
- ✅ Import statement added for cleanYoutubeTranscript (line 8)
- ✅ source-raw.txt backup saves original with timestamps (lines 84-91)
- ✅ AI cleaning integrated with error handling (lines 94-105)
- ✅ Progress updates added for 5 stages (15%, 20%, 25% with success/warning)
- ✅ Graceful degradation: Falls back to original on any failure
- ✅ Code compiles successfully (validated in IDE)

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Import statement added for cleanYoutubeTranscript
- [x] source-raw.txt backup logic implemented
- [x] AI cleaning call integrated with error handling
- [x] Progress updates added for all stages
- [x] Graceful degradation implemented
- [x] Code compiles without errors

#### T13: Update rechunkMarkdown for Complete Metadata ✅ COMPLETE

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 1.5 hours  
**Dependencies**: T12  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-09-27)

**Completion Notes**:
- ✅ Enhanced prompt with "CRITICAL" emphasis on all 4 metadata fields
- ✅ Added `required` array to JSON schema enforcing all fields
- ✅ Implemented validation loop with safe defaults (themes: ['general'], importance_score: 0.5, summary: first 100 chars)
- ✅ Added console.warn logs for all defaulted fields with chunk index
- ✅ Applied validation to both main parsing and JSON repair paths
- ✅ Type checking passed (npm run build successful)
- ✅ Modified lines 631-770 in worker/handlers/process-document.ts

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to enhance the rechunkMarkdown function to enforce complete metadata  
**So that** all chunks have importance_score, summary, themes, and word_count

**Files to Modify**:
```
└── worker/handlers/process-document.ts - Modify rechunkMarkdown function (lines 593-643)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Update prompt to emphasize metadata requirements ("CRITICAL: Every chunk MUST have...")
2. Add JSON schema with `required` fields for all metadata
3. Implement validation loop after JSON parsing
4. Add safe defaults for missing fields:
   - themes: ['general']
   - importance_score: 0.5
   - summary: chunk.content.slice(0, 100) + '...'
5. Log warnings when defaults are used
6. Test with YouTube video to verify metadata completeness

**Prompt Update**:
```typescript
const prompt = `Break this markdown document into semantic chunks (complete thoughts, 200-2000 characters).

CRITICAL: Every chunk MUST have:
- themes: Array of 2-3 specific topics covered (e.g., ["authentication", "security"])
- importance_score: Float 0.0-1.0 representing how central this content is to the document
- summary: One sentence describing what this chunk covers

Return JSON with this exact structure: {chunks: [{content, themes, importance_score, summary}]}

${markdown}`
```

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:593-643` - Existing rechunkMarkdown
- Validation pattern: `worker/lib/youtube.ts` - Defensive validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: All chunks have complete metadata
  Given cleaned markdown from YouTube
  When rechunkMarkdown processes the content
  Then every chunk should have non-null themes array (length > 0)
  And every chunk should have importance_score between 0.0-1.0
  And every chunk should have non-empty summary string

Scenario 2: Missing metadata gets safe defaults
  Given AI returns chunks with missing metadata
  When validation runs
  Then missing themes should default to ['general']
  And missing importance_score should default to 0.5
  And missing summary should use first 100 chars of content

Scenario 3: Validation warnings are logged
  Given chunks with missing metadata
  When safe defaults are applied
  Then warnings should be logged for each defaulted field
  And chunk index should be included in warning
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Type check
npm run build

# Test metadata completeness (after T16)
npm test youtube-metadata-enhancement.test.ts

# Query database after processing
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(importance_score) as has_importance, COUNT(summary) as has_summary FROM chunks WHERE document_id = 'test-id';"
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [x] Prompt updated to emphasize metadata requirements
- [x] JSON schema includes required fields
- [x] Validation loop implemented with safe defaults
- [x] Warning logs added for defaulted fields
- [ ] Manual test verifies 100% metadata completeness (deferred to T16)
- [x] Code compiles without errors

#### T14: Integrate Fuzzy Matching into Pipeline

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours  
**Dependencies**: T7, T13  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to integrate fuzzy matching after rechunking  
**So that** chunk positions are calculated and stored with confidence scores

**Files to Modify**:
```
└── worker/handlers/process-document.ts - Add fuzzy matching after rechunking (~50 lines)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Import `fuzzyMatchChunkToSource` from `fuzzy-matching.ts`
2. Add condition check: Only run for `sourceType === 'youtube'`
3. Load `source-raw.txt` from storage
4. Loop through chunks and call `fuzzyMatchChunkToSource` for each
5. Store `start_offset`, `end_offset`, and `position_context` on chunk objects
6. Log confidence distribution for monitoring (exact/fuzzy/approximate counts)
7. Handle storage download errors gracefully (log warning, continue)
8. Add progress update: "Calculating chunk positions"

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:350-400` - Post-rechunking processing
- Storage download: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts` - Existing storage operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: Fuzzy matching runs for YouTube videos only
  Given sourceType is 'youtube'
  When processing pipeline runs after rechunking
  Then fuzzy matching should execute
  And all chunks should have position_context calculated

Scenario 2: Chunks get accurate position data
  Given 20 chunks and source-raw.txt
  When fuzzy matching runs
  Then >70% of chunks should have confidence >= 0.7
  And all chunks should have non-null position_context
  And confidence distribution should be logged

Scenario 3: Storage errors don't break processing
  Given source-raw.txt download fails
  When fuzzy matching attempts to load source
  Then error should be logged as warning
  And processing should continue without fuzzy matching
  And chunks should be saved without position data
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Type check
npm run build

# Integration test
npm test youtube-metadata-enhancement.test.ts

# Check confidence distribution
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT position_context->>'method' as method, COUNT(*) FROM chunks WHERE document_id = 'test-id' GROUP BY method;"
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Import statement added for fuzzyMatchChunkToSource
- [ ] YouTube-only condition implemented
- [ ] source-raw.txt loading logic added
- [ ] Fuzzy matching loop implemented
- [ ] position_context stored on chunk objects
- [ ] Confidence distribution logging added
- [ ] Error handling for storage failures
- [ ] Progress updates added
- [ ] Code compiles without errors

#### T15: Update Chunk Insertion with New Fields

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour  
**Dependencies**: T14  
**Assignable To**: Backend Developer

**Task Purpose**:  
**As a** backend developer  
**I need** to update chunk insertion to include position_context and word_count  
**So that** all new metadata is persisted to the database

**Files to Modify**:
```
└── worker/handlers/process-document.ts - Modify chunk insertion loop (~30 lines)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Locate chunk insertion loop (around line 470)
2. Calculate `word_count` using whitespace split: `chunk.content.trim().split(/\s+/).length`
3. Add `start_offset: chunk.start_offset ?? null`
4. Add `end_offset: chunk.end_offset ?? null`
5. Add `position_context: chunk.position_context ?? null`
6. Add `word_count: wordCount`
7. Ensure existing fields remain (themes, importance_score, summary, timestamps)
8. Test insertion with real YouTube video

**Code Patterns to Follow**:
- Similar pattern: `worker/handlers/process-document.ts:470-490` - Existing chunk insertion

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: All metadata fields are inserted
  Given chunks with complete metadata
  When chunk insertion runs
  Then database should have all chunks with non-null:
    - importance_score
    - summary
    - themes (JSONB array)
    - word_count
  And position_context should be present for YouTube chunks

Scenario 2: NULL values handled correctly
  Given chunks without fuzzy matching (non-YouTube)
  When chunk insertion runs
  Then position_context should be NULL
  And start_offset/end_offset should be NULL
  And other metadata should still be present

Scenario 3: Word count calculation is accurate
  Given chunk content with various whitespace
  When word_count is calculated
  Then count should match manual whitespace-split count
  And leading/trailing spaces should be ignored
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Type check
npm run build

# Query database after test
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT id, word_count, importance_score, summary IS NOT NULL as has_summary, position_context IS NOT NULL as has_position FROM chunks WHERE document_id = 'test-id' LIMIT 5;"

# Check for NULL metadata (should be 0 rows)
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunks WHERE document_id = 'test-id' AND (importance_score IS NULL OR summary IS NULL OR themes IS NULL OR word_count IS NULL);"
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] word_count calculation implemented
- [ ] position_context field added to insertion
- [ ] start_offset and end_offset added
- [ ] All existing metadata fields preserved
- [ ] NULL handling verified for non-YouTube
- [ ] Database query confirms all fields populated
- [ ] Code compiles without errors

-- approximate: 0.3 confidence
```

**Query 3: Check for NULL Metadata (should be 0 rows)**
```sql
SELECT id, chunk_index
FROM chunks
WHERE document_id = 'test-doc-id'
  AND (
    importance_score IS NULL 
    OR summary IS NULL 
    OR themes IS NULL 
    OR jsonb_array_length(themes) = 0
    OR word_count IS NULL
  );

-- Expected: 0 rows
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario 1: No NULL metadata in chunks
  Given chunks processed by new pipeline
  When I query for NULL metadata fields
  Then 0 rows should be returned
  And all chunks should have complete metadata

Scenario 2: Position context is valid JSONB
  Given chunks with position_context
  When I query position_context fields
  Then all should have confidence between 0.3-1.0
  And all should have method in [exact, fuzzy, approximate]
  And all should have context_before and context_after strings

Scenario 3: Indexes improve query performance
  Given indexes on position_context fields
  When I EXPLAIN ANALYZE queries filtering by confidence
  Then index scans should be used (not sequential scans)
  And query execution time should be <50ms for 1000 chunks
```

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Run metadata completeness check
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -f docs/validation/metadata-completeness.sql

# Run position context validation
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -f docs/validation/position-context-check.sql

# Test index performance
psql -U postgres -d rhizome -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM chunks WHERE (position_context->>'confidence')::float >= 0.7;"
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Metadata completeness query returns expected results (0 NULL values)
- [ ] Position context distribution is healthy
- [ ] All confidence scores are between 0.3-1.0
- [ ] Indexes are being used by query planner
- [ ] No data integrity issues found
- [ ] Validation results documented

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks

**T5: Implement Fuzzy Matching Core Logic**
- **Risk**: Algorithm may not achieve >90% accuracy on diverse content
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive unit tests (T6) with edge cases, configurable thresholds for tuning
- **Fallback**: Approximate positioning always provides usable offsets, even if low confidence

**T12: Integrate AI Cleaning into Pipeline**
- **Risk**: AI failures could break processing pipeline
- **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation implemented (T8), always falls back to uncleaned markdown
- **Fallback**: Original transcript preserved in source-raw.txt, users can retry

**T14: Integrate Fuzzy Matching into Pipeline**
- **Risk**: Performance issues with very long videos (2+ hours)
- **Mitigation**: Optimizations in T7 (dynamic stride, early exit), performance monitoring added
- **Fallback**: Fuzzy matching can be skipped if storage download fails, processing continues

### Medium-Risk Tasks

**T10: Tune AI Cleaning Prompt**
- **Risk**: Prompt optimization may require multiple iterations
- **Mitigation**: Test with diverse video types, document prompt tuning decisions
- **Fallback**: Current prompt is functional, tuning is enhancement not requirement

**T13: Update rechunkMarkdown for Complete Metadata**
- **Risk**: AI may still occasionally return incomplete metadata
- **Mitigation**: Validation with safe defaults ensures no NULL values ever stored
- **Fallback**: Default values (0.5 importance, 'general' theme) are reasonable

### Low-Risk Tasks

**T1-T3: Database Foundation**
- **Risk**: Minimal - schema changes are additive, no destructive operations
- **Mitigation**: Migration can be reverted if needed, development database easy to reset

**T16-T20: Validation & Testing**
- **Risk**: Minimal - testing phase, no production impact
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures issues caught before deployment

## Success Criteria Summary

### Technical Success Metrics

**Metadata Completeness**:
- [ ] 100% of chunks have non-null importance_score, summary, themes, word_count
- [ ] All importance_scores are between 0.0-1.0
- [ ] All themes arrays have at least 1 element

**Fuzzy Matching Accuracy**:
- [ ] >90% of chunks have confidence ≥ 0.7 (for well-structured content)

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found

**Step 1: Disable YouTube Processing** (Immediate - 5 minutes)
```typescript
// In worker/handlers/process-document.ts, youtube case
case 'youtube': {
  throw new Error('YOUTUBE_TEMPORARILY_DISABLED: YouTube processing is under maintenance. Please try again later.')
}
```

**Step 2: Revert Database Migration** (If needed - 15 minutes)
```sql
-- Create migration: supabase/migrations/013_rollback_youtube_enhancement.sql
ALTER TABLE chunks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS position_context;
-- Only drop word_count if it was added in migration 012
-- ALTER TABLE chunks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS word_count;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunks_position_confidence;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunks_position_method;
```

**Step 3: Revert Code Changes** (If needed - 30 minutes)
```bash
# Identify commit hash of feature
git log --oneline --grep="YouTube Processing & Metadata Enhancement"

# Create revert commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Rebuild and test
npm run build
npm test

# Deploy reverted version
```

**Step 4: Partial Rollback Options**

**Option A: Disable Only AI Cleaning**
- Keep metadata enhancement and fuzzy matching
- Skip `cleanYoutubeTranscript` call
- Use raw markdown for rechunking

**Option B: Disable Only Fuzzy Matching**
- Keep AI cleaning and metadata
- Skip offset calculation
- Leave `position_context` null

**Option C: Use Simplified Prompt**
- Keep pipeline architecture
- Switch to simpler rechunking prompt
- Reduce metadata requirements
