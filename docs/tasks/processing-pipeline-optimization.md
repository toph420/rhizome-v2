‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/engines/orchestrator.ts - Remove deprecated engine references
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Remove deprecated EngineType enum values from types.ts
2. Update DEFAULT_WEIGHTS to only include 3 engines
3. Search and remove all references to deprecated engines
4. Update type exports and interfaces

### Code Patterns to Follow
- **Existing Pattern**: `worker/engines/types.ts:10-30` - Current enum structure
- **Weight Config**: `worker/lib/weight-config.ts:44-89` - Configuration pattern

### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Legacy engine types removed
  Given the types.ts file contains 7 engine definitions
  When I remove the 5 deprecated engine types
  Then only SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY, CONTRADICTION_DETECTION, and THEMATIC_BRIDGE remain
  And the DEFAULT_WEIGHTS object only contains 3 engine weights

Scenario: No orphaned references
  Given legacy engines have been removed
  When I search the codebase for deprecated engine names
  Then no references to TEMPORAL_PROXIMITY, CONCEPTUAL_DENSITY, EMOTIONAL_RESONANCE, CITATION_NETWORK, or STRUCTURAL_PATTERN exist
```

## Task T-009: Simplify to AI-Only Metadata System

**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Phase**: 2 - Batched Processing Implementation

### Context & Background

**Current Problem**: The system has two metadata extraction approaches:
1. **AI metadata** (`batchChunkAndExtractMetadata`) - semantic understanding, $0.20/doc
2. **Regex metadata** (`enrichChunksWithMetadata`) - pattern matching, $0/doc

This creates:
- Schema inconsistencies across documents
- Complex conditional routing logic
- Engines that must handle two metadata formats
- Confusion about which system to use when

**Task Purpose**:
**As a** system architect
**I need** to standardize on AI-only metadata extraction
**So that** we have consistent schemas, simpler code, and semantic understanding for ThematicBridge

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: T-008 (integration complete)
- **Blocked Tasks**: None (simplification)
- **Integration Points**: All processors, collision detection engines

### Technical Requirements

**Files to Modify**:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/pdf-processor.ts - Remove conditional routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/youtube-processor.ts - Switch to AI metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/web-processor.ts - Switch to AI metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/markdown-processor.ts - Switch to AI metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/text-processor.ts - Switch to AI metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/paste-processor.ts - Switch to AI metadata
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/processors/base.ts - Remove enrichChunksWithMetadata method
```

**Files to Deprecate** (move to `.archive/`):
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/lib/metadata-extractor.ts - Legacy regex system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/lib/extractors/*.ts - All regex extractors
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/tests matching above - Corresponding tests
```

**Files to Update**:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/types/ai-metadata.ts - Enhance to include emotional polarity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/engines/contradiction-detection.ts - Use AI metadata schema
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/engines/thematic-bridge.ts - Already uses AI metadata
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Enhance AI metadata schema** to support all 3 engines:
   ```typescript
   export interface AIChunkMetadata {
     themes: string[]
     concepts: Array<{ text: string; importance: number }>
     importance: number
     summary?: string
     domain?: string
     emotional: {
       polarity: number        // -1 to +1 for ContradictionDetection
       primaryEmotion: string  // joy/fear/anger/neutral/etc
       intensity: number       // 0 to 1
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Simplify PDF processor** - remove conditional routing:
   ```typescript
   async process(): Promise<ProcessResult> {
     // Extract markdown (batched if >10MB)
     const markdown = await this.extractMarkdown()

     // ALWAYS use AI metadata (no conditionals)
     const chunks = await batchChunkAndExtractMetadata(markdown)

     return { markdown, chunks }
   }
   ```

3. **Update all other processors** to use `batchChunkAndExtractMetadata`:
   - YouTube, Web, Markdown, Text, Paste processors
   - Remove all calls to `enrichChunksWithMetadata()`

4. **Update collision detection engines**:
   - ContradictionDetection: Use `chunk.metadata.emotional.polarity`
   - ThematicBridge: Already uses AI metadata structure
   - SemanticSimilarity: Metadata-agnostic (no changes)

5. **Archive legacy regex system**:
   - Move `worker/lib/metadata-extractor.ts` ‚Üí `.archive/`
   - Move `worker/lib/extractors/` ‚Üí `.archive/`
   - Keep as reference but remove from builds

6. **Remove base processor method**:
   - Delete `enrichChunksWithMetadata()` from `base.ts`
   - Delete `extractChunkMetadata()` helper

### Code Patterns to Follow
- **AI Integration**: `worker/lib/ai-chunking-batch.ts:54-130` - Main extraction function
- **Progress Tracking**: `worker/processors/pdf-processor.ts:413-424` - Progress callback pattern
- **Error Handling**: `worker/lib/ai-chunking-batch.ts:220-275` - Retry with fallback

### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: All processors use AI metadata
  Given any document processor (PDF, YouTube, Web, etc.)
  When processing a document
  Then batchChunkAndExtractMetadata is called
  And enrichChunksWithMetadata is NOT called
  And regex extractors are NOT imported

Scenario: Enhanced AI metadata schema
  Given AI metadata extraction
  When metadata is returned
  Then it includes emotional.polarity for ContradictionDetection
  And it includes concepts with importance scores for ThematicBridge
  And it includes domain classification

Scenario: Simplified processor code
  Given PDF processor
  When reviewing the code
  Then there is no conditional "should we use AI?" logic
  Then there is no conditional "large vs small document" routing for metadata
  And the process() method is <150 lines (down from 545)

Scenario: Engines consume AI metadata
  Given ContradictionDetection engine
  When analyzing chunks
  Then it reads chunk.metadata.emotional.polarity
  And does not expect regex metadata schema
```

### Validation
```bash
# Verify no imports of legacy extractors
cd worker && grep -r "from.*metadata-extractor" processors/ lib/
# Should return: no results

# Run all processor tests
cd worker && npm test -- processors/

# Run engine tests with new metadata
cd worker && npm test -- engines/contradiction-detection.test.ts
cd worker && npm test -- engines/thematic-bridge.test.ts

# Build verification
cd worker && npm run build
```

### Migration Notes

**Breaking Changes:**
- Old chunks with regex metadata will need re-processing
- Or: Add migration script to transform old metadata ‚Üí AI metadata schema
- Decision: For personal tool, just re-process (simpler)

**Cost Impact:**
- Before: $0 for small docs, $0.20 for large docs (inconsistent)
- After: $0.20 for all docs (consistent, predictable)
- Benefit: Semantic understanding enables ThematicBridge cross-domain connections

## Implementation Recommendations

### Suggested Team Structure
- **Lead Developer**: Focus on T-005, T-006, T-007 (core batching implementation)
- **Integration Developer**: Handle T-001, T-002, T-003, T-008 (system integration)
- **QA Engineer**: Own T-010, T-013, T-014 (validation and quality)
- **Performance Engineer**: Focus on T-011, T-012 (benchmarking and optimization)

### Optimal Task Sequencing

**Week 1 (Phase 1)**:
1. Day 1-2: T-001, T-002, T-003 in parallel (cleanup)
2. Day 3: T-004 (validation)
3. Day 4: Buffer/spillover

**Week 2 (Phase 2)**:
1. Day 1-3: T-005, T-007 in parallel (core implementation)
2. Day 3-4: T-006 (stitching)
3. Day 4-5: T-008 (integration)
4. Day 5: T-009 (cost tracking)

**Week 3 (Phase 3)**:
1. Day 1-2: T-010, T-011, T-012 in parallel (testing/validation)
2. Day 3: T-013 (quality validation)
3. Day 4: T-014 (production readiness)
4. Day 5: Buffer/deployment prep

### Parallelization Opportunities
- **Phase 1**: T-001, T-002, T-003 can be done simultaneously by different developers
- **Phase 2**: T-005 and T-007 can be developed in parallel, then integrated
- **Phase 3**: T-010, T-011, T-012 can run concurrently with different focus areas

### Resource Allocation Suggestions
- Allocate most senior developer to T-005, T-006 (critical path items)
- QA can start preparing test data during Phase 1
- Performance engineer can establish baselines during Phase 1

## Critical Path Analysis

### Tasks on Critical Path
1. **T-001** ‚Üí **T-004** ‚Üí **T-005** ‚Üí **T-006** ‚Üí **T-008** ‚Üí **T-014**
   - These tasks must complete sequentially for feature delivery
   - Total estimated time: 35-42 hours

### Potential Bottlenecks
- **T-006 (Stitching Algorithm)**: Complex fuzzy matching logic may require iterations
- **T-008 (Integration)**: Coordination point where all Phase 2 work converges
- **T-014 (Production Readiness)**: Final gate that depends on all validation

### Schedule Optimization Suggestions
1. Start T-007 (AI metadata) early as it can be developed independently
2. Begin T-009 (cost tracking) as soon as T-007 has basic structure
3. Prepare test fixtures for T-010 during Phase 1
4. Run continuous benchmarking starting from Phase 2
