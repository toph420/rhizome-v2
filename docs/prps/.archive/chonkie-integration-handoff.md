# Chonkie Pipeline Integration - Session Handoff Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: Research Complete, PRP Drafted, Ready for Phase 1 Prototype
**Primary Document**: `docs/prps/chonkie-semantic-chunking-integration.md`

---

## Executive Summary

Researched and designed a comprehensive integration of Chonkie's semantic chunking pipeline into Rhizome's document processing system. The integration uses a **composable pipeline architecture** (CHOMP) that combines Docling's structural extraction with Chonkie's semantic intelligence, potentially improving connection detection by **15-40%** depending on configuration.

**Key Insight**: Rhizome's existing recovery systems (`recoverAnnotations` with 4-tier fuzzy matching, `remapConnections` with embedding-based similarity) are **accidentally perfect** for semantic chunking. This makes it a **low-risk, high-reward** enhancement.

## What We Discovered

### 1. Chonkie Library Overview

**What is Chonkie?**
- YC-backed text chunking library for RAG applications
- 2000+ GitHub stars, actively maintained
- **4.35x faster** than LangChain for semantic chunking
- 8 different chunkers, we focus on 2:
  - **SemanticChunker**: Embedding-based similarity grouping (fast, proven)
  - **SlumberChunker**: LLM-powered boundary decisions (slower, potentially better)

**Key Features**:
- Model2Vec embeddings (500x faster than transformers)
- CHOMP pipeline architecture (composable processing stages)
- OverlapRefinery (adds context between chunks)
- Percentile-based thresholds (adaptive to document)

### 2. Pipeline Architecture (CHOMP)

**CHOMP = CHOnkie's Multi-step Pipeline**

```
Fetcher → Chef → Chunker → Refinery → Porter
   ↓        ↓       ↓         ↓         ↓
(Extract) (Clean) (Split) (Enhance) (Export)
```

**Rhizome Integration**:
```
Docling     → Cleanup → Chonkie  → Overlap    → Metadata
(Fetcher)     (Chef)    (Chunker)  (Refinery)   (Porter)
```

**Three Variants Planned**:
1. **Variant A** (Phase 1-2): SemanticChunker only → 15-20% improvement
2. **Variant B** (Phase 3): SemanticChunker + OverlapRefinery → 20-30% improvement
3. **Variant C** (Phase 5): SlumberChunker + OverlapRefinery → 25-40% improvement

### 3. Critical Discovery: Rhizome's Recovery Systems Are Already Built for This

**Annotation Recovery** (`worker/handlers/recover-annotations.ts`):
- 4-tier fuzzy matching (exact → context → chunk-bounded → trigram)
- Character-offset based (NOT chunk-ID dependent)
- Confidence thresholds: ≥0.85 auto-recover, 0.75-0.85 review, <0.75 lost
- **Works identically with semantic boundaries as with page-break boundaries**
- Expected performance: 90-95% recovery (matches hybrid chunker)

**Connection Remapping** (`worker/handlers/remap-connections.ts`):
- Embedding-based cosine similarity matching
- Thresholds: ≥0.95 auto-remap, 0.85-0.95 review, <0.85 lost
- **Benefits from semantic coherence** (complete concepts = stable embeddings)
- Expected performance: ≥95% auto-remap (potentially BETTER than hybrid)

**Why this matters**: Most document processors would break with semantic chunking. Rhizome won't. This is a **competitive advantage**.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Preserve Docling for Extraction ✅

**Decision**: Keep Docling for PDF/EPUB extraction (Fetcher/Chef stage)
**Reason**: Docling provides structural metadata (pages, headings, bboxes) that Chonkie doesn't extract
**Strategy**: Docling extracts structure → Chonkie creates semantic boundaries → Transfer metadata via offset mapping

### 2. Pipeline Composition Over Single Chunker ✅

**Decision**: Don't choose "hybrid OR semantic" - compose a pipeline
**Reason**: Combines strengths (Docling structure + Chonkie semantics + Overlap context)
**Benefit**: Incremental validation (test each stage independently)

### 3. OverlapRefinery for Connection Detection ✅

**Decision**: Add 50-100 token overlap between chunks (Phase 3+)
**Reason**: Makes thematic bridges EXPLICIT instead of implicit
**Example**:
```
Without overlap:
Chunk 42: "Paranoia emerges as central theme..."
Chunk 43: "Surveillance systems mirror this anxiety..."
→ Connection detection must infer relationship

WITH overlap (50 tokens):
Chunk 42: "Paranoia emerges as central theme in postmodern literature..."
Chunk 43: "...in postmodern literature. Surveillance systems mirror this anxiety..."
→ Overlapping context makes bridge VISIBLE
```

**Hypothesis**: +5-10% additional connection improvement via overlap

### 4. SlumberChunker as Advanced Option ✅

**Decision**: Test SlumberChunker (LLM-powered) in Phase 5 if SemanticChunker succeeds
**Reason**: LLM reasoning understands conceptual arcs better than embedding similarity
**Trade-off**: Slower (+15-20 min) but potentially better quality (+10-20% more connections)
**Constraint**: Only in LOCAL mode (Ollama) to avoid cost explosion

### 5. Phased Rollout Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Incremental validation, not all-at-once implementation
**Phases**:
1. **Phase 1-2** (12-16 hrs): Validate SemanticChunker + recovery systems
2. **Phase 3** (10-12 hrs): A/B test with OverlapRefinery
3. **Phase 4** (8-10 hrs): Evaluate and decide (ship/iterate/abandon)
4. **Phase 5** (optional): Test SlumberChunker if hungry for more quality

## Key Questions to Answer in Phase 1

### Technical Validation
1. **Does offset-based metadata transfer maintain ≥85% quality?**
   - Measure: exact/high/medium/synthetic distribution
   - Target: <15% synthetic chunks

2. **Do recovery systems handle semantic boundaries?**
   - Test: Create annotations → edit markdown → reprocess → measure recovery
   - Target: ≥90% success rate (matching hybrid)

3. **Does semantic coherence improve embedding stability?**
   - Test: Create connections → reprocess → measure remapping
   - Hypothesis: ≥95% auto-remap (better than hybrid)

### Quality Assessment
4. **Do semantic boundaries look better than page boundaries?**
   - Manual review: Read 20 random chunks from each
   - Question: Do semantic chunks feel more coherent?

5. **Are chunk boundaries at natural semantic breaks?**
   - Manual review: Check 10 chunk boundaries
   - Question: Do splits happen at topic shifts, not mid-thought?

### Performance Validation
6. **Is processing time acceptable?**
   - Measure: End-to-end time for 50, 200, 500 page books
   - Target: <30 minutes for 500 pages

7. **What's the chunk count variance?**
   - Measure: Hybrid vs Semantic chunk counts
   - Target: 0.8-1.2x ratio (±20%)

## Important Context for Next Session

### Why This Matters
Rhizome is fundamentally about **finding non-obvious connections between ideas**. Semantic chunking that groups related concepts is *exactly* what could unlock cross-domain thematic bridges. Right now, HybridChunker might split a single argument across pages, fragmenting the conceptual unit. SemanticChunker keeps complete thoughts together.

### Your Competitive Advantage
Most document processors can't do semantic chunking because they rely on stable chunk IDs or fixed offsets. Rhizome's recovery systems are **character-offset based with fuzzy matching**, treating semantic boundary shifts as just another text transformation. This wasn't designed for semantic chunking, but it's the **perfect foundation** for it.

### The Big Opportunity
If Phase 1 validates the approach:
- **Variant B** (Overlap): +5-10% additional improvement by making chunk relationships explicit
- **Variant C** (Slumber): +10-20% via LLM reasoning about conceptual arcs

Combined: **25-40% improvement in connection detection** vs current HybridChunker.

### Risk Mitigation
- Incremental phases (can stop anytime)
- A/B testing validates improvement before shipping
- Recovery systems provide safety net
- User-selectable (no forced migration)
- Reversible (can switch back to hybrid)

## Open Questions & Future Considerations

### Phase 1 Questions
- What's the optimal overlap size? (50, 75, or 100 tokens?)
- Should overlap be trailing, leading, or bidirectional?
- Does Model2Vec (500x faster) have acceptable quality for embeddings?
- Can we detect which documents benefit most from semantic chunking?

### Phase 3+ Questions (if Phase 1 succeeds)
- Does OverlapRefinery actually improve thematic bridge detection?
- Is SlumberChunker worth the added complexity?
- Should this be default for narrative content?
- Can we auto-detect document type (technical vs narrative) and choose chunker?

### Architecture Questions
- Should chunks store overlap metadata separately or inline?
- How do overlapping chunks affect storage size?
- Does the 3-engine system need tuning for overlapping chunks?
- Can we visualize chunk boundaries in the reader UI for debugging?
