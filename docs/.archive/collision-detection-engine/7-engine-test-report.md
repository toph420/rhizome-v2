- **Expected connections**: 3 validated matches including contradictions
- **Processing time**: < 3 seconds

### Large Dataset (100+ chunks)
- **Purpose**: Performance and load testing
- **Content**: Quantum computing themed, programmatically generated
- **Performance target**: < 10 seconds for 100 chunks
- **Stress scenarios**: Concurrent processing, memory efficiency, cache performance

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Cache Overflow**: Cache eviction strategy may impact performance at >5000 entries
2. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>500 chunks) may require increased heap size
3. **Temporal Engine**: Date parsing is strict, non-standard formats may be skipped
4. **Network Timeouts**: Citation network engine sensitive to external service latency

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. Run edge case tests after any input validation changes
2. Use small dataset for rapid development iteration
3. Enable verbose logging for debugging engine issues
4. Monitor memory usage when processing large documents

### For CI/CD
1. Set `CI=true` to skip optional load tests
2. Enforce 80% coverage threshold minimum
3. Run full test suite on major version changes
4. Archive test reports for trend analysis

### For Production
1. Implement monitoring for engine failure rates
2. Configure circuit breakers based on observed patterns
3. Tune cache size based on typical workload
4. Set appropriate timeouts for document size

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
2. Update fixtures in `tests/fixtures/collision-test-data/`
3. Add test suite configuration to `scripts/run-integration-tests.js`
4. Document expected outcomes in this report

### Updating Benchmarks
1. Run performance tests on consistent hardware
2. Average results from multiple runs (minimum 3)
3. Update benchmark tables in this document
4. Tag commits with benchmark updates
