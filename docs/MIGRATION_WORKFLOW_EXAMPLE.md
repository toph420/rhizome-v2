# Migration Workflow - Complete Example

**Scenario**: Adding a "last_viewed" timestamp to documents table
**Purpose**: Educational walkthrough of the complete dual-worktree migration workflow

---

## Current State

**Worktree**: `/Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1` (development)
**Branch**: `homepage-and-search` (feature branch with uncommitted changes)
**Database**: Local (localhost:54322) and Cloud (pqkdcfxkitovcgvjoyuu) are in sync

**Latest Migration**: `070_chunk_connection_detection.sql`

---

## Phase 1: Prepare for New Feature

### Step 1.1: Commit Current Changes

```bash
# We have documentation updates to commit first
git status

# Changes:
# - .gitignore (added .supabase/)
# - CLAUDE.md (added migration workflow rules)
# - docs/DEPLOY.md (updated worktree paths)
# - docs/MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md (new file)

# Commit these changes to current branch
git add .gitignore CLAUDE.md docs/
git commit -m "docs: add dual-worktree migration workflow documentation"
```

**What happened:**
- Documentation changes committed to `homepage-and-search` branch
- These will be merged to main when we merge the feature
- Local commit only (not pushed yet)

### Step 1.2: Create New Feature Branch

```bash
# Create new branch for our example feature
git checkout -b feature/document-last-viewed

# Now we're on a clean branch, ready to develop
```

**What happened:**
- Created new branch from `homepage-and-search`
- Starts with all current changes (including docs)
- Migrations folder is the same (migrations are tracked by git)

---

## Phase 2: Develop Feature (Database Changes)

### Step 2.1: Check Current Schema

```bash
# ALWAYS check schema before making changes
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres -c "\d documents"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Table "public.documents"
Column             | Type                        | Collation | Nullable | Default
-------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+--------
id                 | uuid                        |           | not null | gen_random_uuid()
user_id            | uuid                        |           | not null |
title              | text                        |           |          |
file_name          | text                        |           |          |
file_type          | text                        |           | not null |
uploaded_at        | timestamp with time zone    |           |          | now()
processing_status  | text                        |           |          | 'pending'
processing_completed_at | timestamp with time zone |      |          |
...
```

**Note**: No `last_viewed` column yet (we're about to add it)

### Step 2.2: Generate Migration

```bash
# Create migration for new column
npx supabase db diff -f add_document_last_viewed

# This creates:
# supabase/migrations/20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql
```

**What happened:**
- Supabase CLI compared local DB schema to migration history
- Created new migration file with timestamp prefix
- File is empty (we haven't made schema changes yet)

### Step 2.3: Write Migration SQL

Edit the new migration file:

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql

-- Add last_viewed timestamp column
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN last_viewed TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Create index for efficient queries (most recently viewed)
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_last_viewed ON documents(user_id, last_viewed DESC NULLS LAST);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN documents.last_viewed IS 'Timestamp when user last opened this document in the reader';
```

**Why this migration is safe:**
- ‚úÖ Adding nullable column (no data loss)
- ‚úÖ Index helps performance (doesn't block table)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (existing queries still work)

### Step 2.4: Apply Migration Locally

```bash
# Apply the new migration to local DB
npx supabase migration up

# Check it worked
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres -c "\d documents"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Column             | Type                        | Collation | Nullable | Default
-------------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+--------
...
last_viewed        | timestamp with time zone    |           |          |
```

**What happened:**
- Migration applied to local database (localhost:54322)
- `documents` table now has `last_viewed` column
- Cloud database still doesn't have it (we haven't pushed yet)

---

## Phase 3: Develop Feature (Code Changes)

### Step 3.1: Update Server Action

Create or update the Server Action that runs when viewing documents:

```typescript
// src/app/actions/documents.ts
'use server'

import { getServerSupabaseClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

export async function updateLastViewed(documentId: string) {
  const supabase = getServerSupabaseClient()

  // Update last_viewed timestamp
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('documents')
    .update({ last_viewed: new Date().toISOString() })
    .eq('id', documentId)

  if (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update last_viewed:', error)
    return { success: false }
  }

  revalidatePath(`/read/${documentId}`)
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Step 3.2: Call from Document Reader

Update the document reader page to call this action:

```typescript
// src/app/read/[id]/page.tsx
import { updateLastViewed } from '@/app/actions/documents'

export default async function DocumentReaderPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Update last_viewed when page loads
  await updateLastViewed(params.id)

  // Rest of page rendering...
  return <DocumentReader documentId={params.id} />
}
```

### Step 3.3: Test Locally

```bash
# Start local development server
npm run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:3000
# Navigate to a document
# Check database to verify last_viewed was updated:

psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres -c "
  SELECT title, last_viewed
  FROM documents
  WHERE last_viewed IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY last_viewed DESC
  LIMIT 5;
"
```

**Expected output:**
```
       title        |          last_viewed
--------------------+--------------------------------
 My Test Document   | 2025-10-26 15:35:42.123456+00
```

**What happened:**
- Code calls Server Action when viewing document
- Server Action updates `last_viewed` timestamp
- Local database reflects the change
- Cloud database still doesn't have the column (not deployed yet)

---

## Phase 4: Commit Changes

### Step 4.1: Review Changes

```bash
# See what files changed
git status

# Review migration file
git diff supabase/migrations/

# Review code changes
git diff src/
```

### Step 4.2: Commit Everything Together

```bash
# Add migration AND code together
git add supabase/migrations/20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql
git add src/app/actions/documents.ts
git add src/app/read/[id]/page.tsx

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: track document last viewed timestamp

- Add last_viewed column to documents table
- Update last_viewed when opening document in reader
- Add index for efficient recent documents queries"

# Push to GitHub (feature branch)
git push origin feature/document-last-viewed
```

**What happened:**
- Migration file committed to git (it's just a file)
- Code changes committed to git
- Pushed to GitHub on feature branch
- Vercel does NOT deploy (we didn't push to main)
- Cloud database does NOT get migration (we didn't run db push)

---

## Phase 5: Merge to Main (The Critical Part!)

### Step 5.1: Switch to Main

```bash
# Make sure we're in dev worktree
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Get latest from remote
git pull origin main
```

**What happened:**
- Switched from feature branch to main
- Pulled any new changes from GitHub
- Local DB still has the migration applied (migrations persist across branches)

### Step 5.2: Merge Feature Branch

```bash
# Merge our feature branch
git merge feature/document-last-viewed --no-edit

# What's in the merge:
# 1. Migration file: supabase/migrations/20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql
# 2. Code changes: src/app/actions/documents.ts
# 3. Code changes: src/app/read/[id]/page.tsx
```

**What happened:**
- Feature branch merged into main
- Migration file is now in main branch (tracked by git)
- Code changes are now in main branch
- Still only local - not pushed to GitHub yet

### Step 5.3: Push to GitHub (Triggers Vercel)

```bash
# Push main to GitHub
git push origin main

# This triggers:
# ‚úÖ GitHub receives new code
# ‚úÖ Vercel detects push to main
# ‚úÖ Vercel starts building and deploying
# ‚ùå Cloud database does NOT have new column yet!
```

**Timeline:**
```
00:00 - Push to GitHub
00:05 - Vercel starts build
00:30 - Vercel build completes
00:35 - Vercel deployment live

At this point:
- ‚úÖ New code is deployed (updateLastViewed function exists)
- ‚ùå Database schema is old (no last_viewed column)
- üö® Users accessing the site will see errors! (trying to update non-existent column)
```

**This is why timing matters!**

### Step 5.4: Push Migration IMMEDIATELY

```bash
# Apply migration to cloud database
npx supabase db push

# This:
# 1. Compares supabase/migrations/ (main branch) to cloud state
# 2. Finds new migration: 20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql
# 3. Applies it to production database
```

**Timeline continues:**
```
00:35 - Vercel deployment live (but broken!)
00:36 - Run: npx supabase db push
00:38 - Migration applied to cloud
00:38 - ‚úÖ Everything working! Code + Schema aligned
```

**Ideal timing:**
```bash
# Do this immediately, don't wait
git push origin main && npx supabase db push

# Or even better (one command):
git push origin main ; npx supabase db push
```

**What happened:**
- Cloud database now has `last_viewed` column
- Deployed code can now successfully update it
- Users can view documents without errors
- Feature is fully deployed!

---

## Phase 6: Update Production Worker (Optional)

If worker code changed, update the production worktree:

```bash
# Switch to production worktree
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2

# Pull latest main
git pull origin main

# Worker now has latest code
# Restart worker if needed:
cd worker
# Ctrl+C to stop
npm start
```

**In our case:**
- Worker code didn't change
- No need to restart
- Worker keeps running

---

## Phase 7: Verify Everything Works

### Step 7.1: Check Cloud Database

```bash
# Verify migration applied to cloud
npx supabase migration list --linked

# Should show:
# 070 | 070 | 070
# 20250126153000 | 20250126153000 | 20250126153000  ‚Üê New migration!
```

### Step 7.2: Check Production Deployment

```bash
# Visit production URL
# Navigate to a document
# Check cloud database:

npx supabase db remote --linked sql "
  SELECT title, last_viewed
  FROM documents
  WHERE last_viewed IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY last_viewed DESC
  LIMIT 5;
"
```

**Expected output:**
```
       title        |          last_viewed
--------------------+--------------------------------
 My Test Document   | 2025-10-26 15:45:22.654321+00
```

**Success!** Feature is fully deployed and working!

## Key Insights

### 1. Migrations Are Just Files

```
supabase/migrations/20250126153000_add_document_last_viewed.sql

This is tracked by git, like any other file:
- It moves between branches when you merge
- It's in version history
- It's pushed to GitHub with your code
```

### 2. Two Separate Systems

```
Git (GitHub)                 Supabase (Cloud)
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ                 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Tracks code                  Tracks which migrations ran
Tracks migration files       Applies migrations to DB
Triggers Vercel              Updates schema

git push origin main     ‚Üí   Vercel deploys code
npx supabase db push     ‚Üí   Cloud DB gets schema
```

### 3. Timing Control

```
You control when migrations apply:

Option 1 (Recommended): Immediate
git push origin main && npx supabase db push
‚Üë Code deploys        ‚Üë Schema updates
  (0-30 seconds)        (immediate)

Option 2 (Dangerous): Delayed
git push origin main
... wait 5 minutes ...
npx supabase db push
‚Üë Code deploys        ‚Üë Schema updates (finally!)
  (users see errors!)    (errors stop)
```

### 4. Development Workflow

```
ALL work happens in dev worktree:
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
/Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1
‚îú‚îÄ Create feature branches here
‚îú‚îÄ Develop and test here
‚îú‚îÄ Merge to main here
‚îî‚îÄ Push migrations from here

Production worktree ONLY runs worker:
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
/Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2
‚îú‚îÄ Always on main branch
‚îú‚îÄ Pulls updates from GitHub
‚îú‚îÄ Runs worker process
‚îî‚îÄ Never creates migrations
```

---

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I need to make more changes after merging?

**A**: Create a new feature branch from main:

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/fix-last-viewed
# Make changes
git commit -m "fix: handle null last_viewed"
git push origin feature/fix-last-viewed

# Then merge again:
git checkout main
git merge feature/fix-last-viewed
git push origin main
npx supabase db push  # If migration changed
```

### Q: What if I need to rollback a migration?

**A**: Create a new migration to undo it:

```bash
npx supabase db diff -f rollback_last_viewed

# In the migration file:
ALTER TABLE documents DROP COLUMN last_viewed;
DROP INDEX idx_documents_last_viewed;

# Apply locally and test
npx supabase migration up

# Then deploy as normal
git add supabase/migrations/
git commit -m "rollback: remove last_viewed feature"
git push origin main
npx supabase db push
```

**Never edit or delete old migration files after pushing!**

### Q: Can I develop in the production worktree?

**A**: No! ALWAYS use the dev worktree:

```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2
git checkout -b feature/something

# ‚úÖ Correct
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1
git checkout -b feature/something
```

### Q: What if local and cloud migrations get out of sync?

**A**: Check and fix:

```bash
# Check status
npx supabase migration list --linked

# If cloud is behind:
npx supabase db push

# If cloud is ahead (rare):
npx supabase db pull  # Downloads new migration files
```

---

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the complete workflow:

1. **Practice**: Create a small feature following these steps
2. **Document**: Add notes to this file about edge cases you encounter
3. **Automate**: Consider creating bash functions for common operations
4. **Share**: Use this as reference for future features

**Remember**: Storage-first architecture means you can afford to be aggressive with schema changes. If something breaks, you can always reprocess from markdown!
