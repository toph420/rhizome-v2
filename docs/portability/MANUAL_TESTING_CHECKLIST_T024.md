**Additional Bugs Fixed (Session 3)**:
- Bug #10: Job ID replacement issue → Fixed: Added `replaceJob()` method
- Bug #11: Import state stuck (Promise never resolves) → Fixed: Store resolve/reject callbacks
- Bug #11b: Unnecessary scanning on cancel → Fixed: Track `successfulImports` count
- Bug #11c: Misleading "failed" jobs → Fixed: Call `removeJob()` instead of marking failed
- Bug #12: Polling state inconsistency → Fixed: Auto-stop polling in `removeJob()`
- Bug #13: Job not appearing after cancel→retry → Fixed: Fallback to create new job
- Bug #14: Dialog double-close issue → Fixed: Remove `onClose()` from success paths
- Bug #15: 'skip' strategy UUID error → Fixed: Handle 'skip' specially in Promise callback
- Bug #16: Page refresh on button click → Fixed: Add `type="button"` to dialog buttons

## Data Integrity Validation ✅

### Critical Data Integrity Checks

1. **Round-Trip Test: Export → Delete DB → Import → Verify**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Process document
   # Step 2: Export document to ZIP
   # Step 3: Delete all chunks from database
   DELETE FROM chunks WHERE document_id = '<doc_id>';
   # Step 4: Import from Storage (or extracted ZIP)
   # Step 5: Verify data matches
   ```
   - [ ] Chunk count matches
   - [ ] Chunk content matches
   - [ ] Metadata matches
   - [ ] Annotations preserved (if merge_smart used)

2. **Connection Preservation**
   - [ ] Mark 10 connections as validated
   - [ ] Reprocess with Smart Mode
   - [ ] Verify 10 validated connections still exist
   - [ ] Verify backup file created

3. **Annotation Preservation** (if annotation system exists)
   - [ ] Create 5 annotations on document
   - [ ] Import with merge_smart strategy
   - [ ] Verify all 5 annotations still work
   - [ ] Annotations point to correct chunks

**Expected Result**: Zero data loss, all data integrity checks pass.

## Final Validation ✅

### Complete System Health Check

1. **Run Automated Validation**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/validate-complete-system.ts --full
   ```
   - [ ] All automated tests pass
   - [ ] No failures reported

2. **Console Check**
   - [ ] Open browser DevTools Console
   - [ ] Navigate through all Admin Panel tabs
   - [ ] Perform key operations
   - [ ] **No console errors** (warnings OK if expected)

3. **Database Check**
   ```sql
   -- Check no orphaned data
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunks WHERE document_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM documents);
   -- Should be 0

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunk_connections WHERE source_chunk_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM chunks);
   -- Should be 0
   ```
   - [ ] No orphaned chunks
   - [ ] No orphaned connections
   - [ ] Database integrity intact

4. **Storage Check**
   - [ ] Open Supabase Storage UI
   - [ ] Navigate through document folders
   - [ ] Verify all processed documents have complete file sets
   - [ ] No corrupted JSON files

**Expected Result**: Complete system is healthy, no errors, no data loss.

### Session 3 Progress (2025-10-14 - continued)

**Completed**:
- ✅ Phase 4: Conflict Resolution refinement (T-012 continued)
- 🟡 Deep debugging of import workflow state management
- 🟡 Promise lifecycle and job ID replacement testing

**Bugs Fixed This Session** (11 total):

1. **Bug #10: Job ID Replacement Issue**
   - **Problem**: `updateJob()` changed internal `id` field but kept Map key as temp ID, causing polling to skip the job
   - **Fix**: Added `replaceJob()` method that removes old job and creates new one with real UUID
   - **Files**: `src/stores/admin/background-jobs.ts`, `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

2. **Bug #11: Import State Stuck (Promise Never Resolves)**
   - **Problem**: Dialog close/cancel didn't resolve Promise, causing `isImporting` state to hang forever
   - **Fix**: Store both resolve and reject callbacks in `currentConflict` state, call them on all exit paths
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

3. **Bug #11b: Unnecessary Scanning on Cancel**
   - **Problem**: `scan()` called unconditionally after import loop, even when user just cancelled
   - **Fix**: Track `successfulImports` count, only scan if > 0
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

4. **Bug #11c: Misleading "Failed" Jobs**
   - **Problem**: Cancelled/skipped imports showed as "failed" jobs in UI
   - **Fix**: Call `removeJob()` instead of marking as failed - no job appears if nothing imported
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

5. **Bug #12: Polling State Inconsistency**
   - **Problem**: `removeJob()` didn't check if polling should stop, causing inconsistent state
   - **Fix**: Added auto-stop polling logic to `removeJob()` (matching `updateJob()`)
   - **Files**: `src/stores/admin/background-jobs.ts`

6. **Bug #13: Job Not Appearing After Cancel→Retry**
   - **Problem**: `replaceJob()` silently failed if old job didn't exist
   - **Fix**: Added fallback to create new job from scratch if old job not found, plus comprehensive logging
   - **Files**: `src/stores/admin/background-jobs.ts`

7. **Bug #14: Dialog Double-Close Issue**
   - **Problem**: Dialog called `onResolved(jobId)` then `onClose()`, triggering `onRejected()` and causing "Import cancelled" error
   - **Fix**: Removed `onClose()` calls from dialog success paths - let `handleConflictResolved` close dialog
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/ConflictResolutionDialog.tsx`

8. **Bug #15: 'skip' Strategy UUID Error**
   - **Problem**: Calling `replaceJob(tempJobId, 'skip')` created job with ID 'skip', causing PostgreSQL UUID error
   - **Fix**: Handle 'skip' in Promise callback - call `removeJob()` instead of `replaceJob()`
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

9. **Bug #16: Page Refresh on Button Click**
   - **Problem**: Buttons missing `type="button"` defaulted to `type="submit"`, causing form submission/page refresh
   - **Fix**: Added `type="button"` to both "Cancel" and "Apply Resolution" buttons
   - **Files**: `src/components/admin/ConflictResolutionDialog.tsx`

10. **Bug #17: Panel Flashing During Job**
    - **Problem**: `useEffect` with `scan` in dependencies re-scanned on every render during job updates
    - **Fix**: Changed to empty dependency array `[]` - scan only on mount
    - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

11. **Bug #18: handleConflictResolved Missing onResolved Call**
    - **Problem**: After refactor, `handleConflictResolved` never called `onResolved()`, so worker never started
    - **Fix**: Added `currentConflict.onResolved?.(jobId)` call
    - **Files**: `src/components/admin/tabs/ImportTab.tsx`

**Key Learnings**:
1. State management is hard - Promise callbacks, Zustand stores, and React state need careful coordination
2. Button types matter - Always specify `type="button"` in dialogs to prevent form submission
3. useEffect dependencies - Empty array `[]` for mount-only effects, avoid function references that change
4. Job lifecycle management - Need consistent handling across all exit paths (success, cancel, error)
5. Polling state - All job mutations must check if polling should start/stop

**Final Result**: Import workflow now works correctly:
- ✅ Cancel/close dialog → No job, no refresh
- ✅ Skip strategy → No job, clean exit
- ✅ Replace/Merge strategies → Job appears, updates smoothly, no flashing
- ✅ No page refreshes, no unnecessary scans, no UI flickering
