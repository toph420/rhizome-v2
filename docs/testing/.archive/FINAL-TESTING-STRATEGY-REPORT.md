- Engine tests are failing due to configuration issues
- Database integration tests need mock fixes
- Some newer features lack test coverage

**Test Failures**:
- 35 test suites failing (primarily mock configuration)
- Engine tests failing due to incorrect setup
- Database operation tests need chain mocking fixes
- Missing test fixtures for some integration tests

**Missing Components**:
- MSW for consistent API mocking (optional)
- Performance regression testing (framework ready)
- Load testing for document processing
- Visual regression testing for UI components

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix Existing Test Failures (Priority: High)
```bash
# Fix test suite failures
npm test -- --verbose

# Focus on:
- Mock configuration in database tests
- Engine test setup and configuration  
- Missing test fixture files
- Chain method mocking in Supabase tests
```

### 2. Target Realistic Coverage Goals (Priority: Medium)
```bash
# Incremental coverage improvements
- Target 50% main app coverage (from 33%)
- Target 60% worker coverage (from 35%)
- Focus on critical paths first
- Add processor integration tests
```

### 3. Production Readiness (Priority: Medium)
```bash
# Prepare for team adoption
