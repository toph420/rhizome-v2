# Coverage Analysis Report - T-010
**Generated**: January 30, 2025  
**Target**: 50% Test Coverage Milestone  

## Executive Summary

Current test coverage across the Rhizome V2 codebase shows significant gaps in critical paths:
- **Worker Module**: 34% lines, 25% branches (162 failing tests)
- **Main Project**: 27% lines, 22% branches (some integration tests failing)

## Critical Path Analysis

### Priority 1: Failing Tests (BLOCKING)
Before improving coverage, we must fix the 162 failing tests that are blocking progress:

**Worker Module Failures:**
- `contradiction-detection.test.ts` - Detection algorithm not finding contradictions
- `emotional-resonance.test.ts` - Emotional harmony detection failing
- `structural-pattern.test.ts` - Pattern scoring thresholds too strict
- `scoring.test.ts` - Weight contribution calculations incorrect

**Main Project Failures:**
- `gemini-cache.test.ts` - Crypto module import issues
- `database/embeddings.test.ts` - Mock Supabase API incomplete
- `database/migrations.test.ts` - Mock chaining methods missing

### Priority 2: ECS System (1.75% Coverage)
**File**: `src/lib/ecs/ecs.ts`  
**Current Coverage**: 1.75% lines (28-307 uncovered)  
**Business Impact**: Critical - Core entity management system

**Missing Coverage:**
- Entity creation and lifecycle
- Component management 
- Query system operations
- User isolation validation
- Error handling patterns

### Priority 3: Document Processing (5.87% Coverage)
**Location**: `worker/processors/`  
**Current Coverage**: 5.87% overall  
**Business Impact**: High - Primary user feature

**Critical Gaps:**
- `pdf-processor.ts`: 3.63% (95-408 uncovered)
- `markdown-processor.ts`: 0% (42-235 uncovered)  
- `youtube-processor.ts`: 0% (34-262 uncovered)
- `web-processor.ts`: 0% (37-220 uncovered)
- `text-processor.ts`: 0% (40-131 uncovered)

### Priority 4: Vector Operations (0% Coverage)
**File**: `worker/lib/ai/vector-search.ts`  
**Current Coverage**: 0% (38-220 uncovered)  
**Business Impact**: Critical - Powers connection detection

**Missing Coverage:**
- Embedding similarity search
- pgvector operations
- Performance optimization
- Error handling for vector operations

### Priority 5: Collision Detection Engines (34% Coverage)
**Location**: `worker/engines/`  
**Current Issues**: Tests exist but failing due to algorithm tuning

**Specific Problems:**
- Scoring thresholds too aggressive
- Mock data doesn't match real-world patterns
- Weight calculation logic errors
- Confidence scoring inconsistencies
