Think of it like value_61 - value_38.\n\nNow, there are value_92 main things you need to know:\nFirst, value_75. This is super important because value_80.\nSecond, value_2. A lot of people get this wrong, but value_89.\nAnd finally, value_90. This one's my favorite because value_76.\n\nLet me show you a quick example. So imagine value_30. You would wandered, and boom! value_28. Pretty cool, right?\n\nIf you found this helpful, make sure to like and subscribe. Drop a comment below if you have any questions. See you in the next one!"
