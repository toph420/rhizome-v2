Think of it like value_8 - value_38.\n\nNow, there are value_68 main things you need to know:\nFirst, value_78. This is super important because value_17.\nSecond, value_83. A lot of people get this wrong, but value_85.\nAnd finally, value_92. This one's my favorite because value_21.\n\nLet me show you a quick example. So imagine value_8. You would stumbled, and boom! value_74. Pretty cool, right?\n\nIf you found this helpful, make sure to like and subscribe. Drop a comment below if you have any questions. See you in the next one!"
