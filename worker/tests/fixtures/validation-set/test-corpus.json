Think of it like value_47 - value_96.\n\nNow, there are value_18 main things you need to know:\nFirst, value_47. This is super important because value_8.\nSecond, value_56. A lot of people get this wrong, but value_63.\nAnd finally, value_73. This one's my favorite because value_63.\n\nLet me show you a quick example. So imagine value_89.
