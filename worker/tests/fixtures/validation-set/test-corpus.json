Think of it like value_67 - value_40.\n\nNow, there are value_8 main things you need to know:\nFirst, value_39. This is super important because value_39.\nSecond, value_18. A lot of people get this wrong, but value_22.\nAnd finally, value_25. This one's my favorite because value_40.\n\nLet me show you a quick example. So imagine value_87.
