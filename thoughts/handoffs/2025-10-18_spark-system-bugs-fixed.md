**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Bug fixes complete, needs comprehensive testing
**Plan**: `thoughts/plans/2025-10-18_spark-system-ecs.md`
**Previous Handoff**: `thoughts/handoffs/2025-10-18_spark-system-ecs.md`

## What Was Done

### Context
Phases 1-5 of spark system were complete, but several UX and performance issues emerged during testing:
- Text selection conflicts between spark and annotation panels
- Severe typing lag in spark textarea
- UI freezing and performance degradation
- Annotation color updates not reflecting immediately
- Spark panel covering reading area
- Missing click-to-edit functionality

### Bug Fixes Applied

#### 1. Text Selection & Performance Issues ✅

**Root Causes**:
- Aggressive `selectionchange` event listener trying to restore ranges constantly
- Synchronous tag/chunk extraction on every keystroke
- Fighting browser's natural selection clearing behavior

**Solutions**:
1. **Removed selection restoration logic** (`QuickSparkCapture.tsx`)
   - Deleted entire `selectionchange` listener effect
   - Kept frozen selection DATA, dropped visual restoration
   - Result: No more UI freezing

2. **Debounced extraction** (`QuickSparkCapture.tsx:77-82`)
   ```typescript
   const [debouncedContent, setDebouncedContent] = useState('')

   useEffect(() => {
     const timer = setTimeout(() => {
       setDebouncedContent(content)
     }, 300)
     return () => clearTimeout(timer)
   }, [content])

   const extractedTags = useMemo(() => extractTags(debouncedContent), [debouncedContent])
   ```
   - 300ms debounce prevents lag during fast typing
   - Extraction only runs after user pauses

3. **Fixed state management** (`ReaderLayout.tsx:118-120`)
   - Was incorrectly using `quickCaptureOpen` for spark panel
   - Now correctly uses `sparkCaptureOpen`
   - Prevents annotation panel when spark panel owns selection

#### 2. Annotation Color Update Issue ✅

**Root Cause**:
- Added `revalidatePath` call thinking it would help
- Wrong layer - that's for server cache, not client state
- Actually unnecessary - Zustand handles client updates

**Solution**:
- Removed `revalidatePath` import and call (`annotations.ts:4, 181-182`)
- Zustand store already creates new references correctly
- Result: Instant visual updates

#### 3. Spark Panel UX Improvements ✅

**Changes**:
1. **Moved to left side** (`QuickSparkCapture.tsx:227`)
   ```typescript
   className="fixed left-0 top-20 bottom-20 z-50 w-[400px]"
   initial={{ x: '-100%' }}  // Slide from left
   ```
   - Was centered bottom, now left side panel
   - Doesn't cover reading area
   - Consistent with typical app layouts

2. **Fixed scroll position** (`QuickSparkCapture.tsx:206`)
   ```typescript
   chunkElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' })
   ```
   - Was `block: 'center'` (annotation at bottom of viewport)
   - Now `block: 'start'` (annotation in upper half, visible)

3. **Click-to-edit sparks**
   - Added `editingSparkContent` to UIStore
   - SparksTab: Added `handleSparkClick` to set content and open panel
   - QuickSparkCapture: Pre-fills content when `editingSparkContent` set
   - Allows editing/viewing existing sparks

4. **Connection context fallbacks** (`QuickSparkCapture.tsx:143-146`)
   ```typescript
   originChunkId: currentChunkId || visibleChunks[0] || '',
   activeConnections: connections || [],
   ```
   - Ensures connections always captured even if props empty

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

**Core Fixes**:
- `src/components/reader/QuickSparkCapture.tsx` - Debouncing, left panel, edit mode
- `src/components/reader/ReaderLayout.tsx` - Fixed spark state references
- `src/app/actions/annotations.ts` - Removed unnecessary revalidatePath
- `src/stores/ui-store.ts` - Added `editingSparkContent` state
- `src/components/sidebar/SparksTab.tsx` - Added click-to-edit handler

**Documentation**:
- `thoughts/plans/2025-10-18_spark-system-ecs.md` - Added implementation log
- `thoughts/handoffs/2025-10-18_spark-system-bugs-fixed.md` - This file

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Data persistence over visual persistence**
   - Accept that browser clears visual selection
   - Preserve selection data in frozen state
   - Show in UI, don't fight browser

2. **Debouncing over synchronous processing**
   - Better UX than blocking operations
   - 300ms is imperceptible delay
   - Prevents lag during fast typing

3. **UIStore for cross-component state**
   - `sparkCaptureOpen` - Panel visibility
   - `pendingAnnotationSelection` - Annotation from spark panel
   - `editingSparkContent` - Pre-fill when editing
   - Clean, no prop drilling

4. **Simplicity over cleverness**
   - Removed over-engineered selection restoration
   - Used straightforward Zustand patterns
   - Followed existing annotation patterns

## Current State

### Working Features ✅

**Spark Creation**:
- ✅ Cmd+K opens left-side panel
- ✅ Auto-quotes selected text
- ✅ Debounced tag extraction (#tags)
- ✅ Debounced chunk linking (/chunk_id)
- ✅ Live preview of tags/chunks
- ✅ Cmd+Enter to save
- ✅ No typing lag
- ✅ No UI freezing

**Selection Behavior**:
- ✅ Spark panel open → annotation panel doesn't appear
- ✅ Spark panel closed → annotation panel appears on selection
- ✅ "Quote This" button adds to spark
- ✅ "Create Annotation" button opens annotation panel (spark stays open)
- ✅ Selection data preserved (visual may disappear, data stays)

**Annotation System**:
- ✅ Color click saves immediately (panel stays open)
- ✅ Letter key saves and closes
- ✅ Cmd+Enter saves and closes
- ✅ Visual updates instantly
- ✅ Panel is draggable

**Spark Timeline**:
- ✅ Shows recent sparks with tags
- ✅ Auto-refreshes every 5s
- ✅ Click spark to edit (opens panel with content)
- ✅ Timestamp relative formatting

### Needs Verification ⚠️

**Critical**:
1. **Connections actually being saved**
   - Code looks correct (buildSparkConnections called)
   - Context passed with activeConnections
   - Need to verify Storage JSON has connections array
   - Need to verify timeline shows connection count

2. **Storage JSON completeness**
   - Check spark JSONs in Storage have all fields
   - Verify context preservation
   - Check metadata accuracy

3. **Cache updates**
   - Sparks appearing in timeline (working)
   - But verify cache table actually being updated
   - Check `sparks_cache` table directly

**Nice-to-Have**:
4. **Selection edge cases**
   - Multi-chunk selections
   - Word boundary snapping behavior
   - Selection in headers/lists/code blocks

5. **Performance under load**
   - Timeline with 1000+ sparks
   - Tag extraction with very long content
   - Search functionality (exists but no UI)

---

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Known Issues

1. **Selection expansion** (intermittent)
   - Occasionally selection expands to include text before cursor
   - Likely related to word boundary snapping in offset calculator
   - Low priority - doesn't break functionality

2. **Edit vs Create mode**
   - Currently all spark submissions create new sparks
   - No way to update existing spark
   - Click-to-edit opens spark but saves as new one

3. **Type safety**
   - Some `any` types in selection handling (QuickSparkCapture)
   - `pendingAnnotationSelection: any | null` should be typed
   - Low priority - working correctly

### Future Work

1. **Spark update/delete**
   - Add edit mode to QuickSparkCapture
   - Delete button in spark cards
   - Update action in sparks.ts

2. **Search UI**
   - `searchSparks` action exists
   - Need search input in SparksTab
   - Fuzzy matching on content/tags

3. **Obsidian export** (Phase 6)
   - Integration exists for annotations
   - Need to add spark export
   - Format: `vault/.sparks/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

4. **Deduplication**
   - No prevention of duplicate sparks
   - Could check content similarity
   - Low priority for personal tool

5. **Performance optimizations**
   - Virtual scrolling for timeline (if >1000 sparks)
   - Extract tag/chunk logic to worker
   - Cache search results

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests

**Spark Creation Flow**:
- [ ] Open document, press Cmd+K
- [ ] Panel slides in from left (not blocking reading)
- [ ] Select text first, press Cmd+K → auto-quotes
- [ ] Type with #tags → see yellow badges appear (after 300ms)
- [ ] Type with /chunk_ids → see blue badges appear (after 300ms)
- [ ] No lag when typing fast
- [ ] Cmd+Enter saves spark
- [ ] Check SparksTab → spark appears within 5s

**Selection Conflicts**:
- [ ] Spark panel closed → select text → annotation panel appears
- [ ] Spark panel open → select text → NO annotation panel, see "Quote This" / "Create Annotation"
- [ ] Click "Quote This" → adds quote to spark, selection cleared
- [ ] Click "Create Annotation" → annotation panel appears, spark panel stays open
- [ ] Create annotation scrolls into view (upper half of viewport)

**Annotation Updates**:
- [ ] Create annotation with letter key (e.g., 'y' for yellow)
- [ ] Click annotation to edit
- [ ] Click different color → updates INSTANTLY
- [ ] Panel stays open, can add notes/tags
- [ ] Cmd+Enter saves and closes

**Spark Editing**:
- [ ] Click spark in SparksTab
- [ ] Panel opens with content pre-filled
- [ ] Can edit content
- [ ] Currently saves as new spark (expected - update not implemented)

**Connections** (CRITICAL - VERIFY):
- [ ] Create spark while reading
- [ ] Check Storage JSON has `connections` array with origin chunk
- [ ] Check timeline shows connection count
- [ ] Verify inherited connections from origin chunk
- [ ] Verify mentioned chunks (/chunk_id) in connections

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check sparks cache
SELECT * FROM sparks_cache ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check ECS entities
SELECT * FROM ecs_entities
WHERE user_id = '<your-user-id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check ECS components
SELECT * FROM ecs_components
WHERE entity_id IN (
  SELECT entity_id FROM ecs_entities
  WHERE user_id = '<your-user-id>'
)
AND component_type = 'spark';
```

### Storage Verification

1. Open Supabase Storage
2. Navigate to `users/<user-id>/sparks/`
3. Download latest spark JSON
4. Verify structure:
```json
{
  "entity_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "component_type": "spark",
  "data": {
    "content": "...",
    "created_at": "...",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "connections": [
      {
        "chunkId": "...",
        "type": "origin",
        "strength": 1.0
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "documentId": "...",
    "originChunkId": "...",
    "activeConnections": [...]
  }
}
```
