## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented (2025-10-27 Session)

### Feature: Chunk Metadata Refresh on Enrichment Completion

**Problem**: After enrichment completed, ChunkMetadataIcon didn't show updated metadata without page refresh.

**Root Causes**:
1. `ChunkMetadataIcon` read chunk data from **props** (Server Component), not from ReaderStore
2. BackgroundJobsStore polling didn't fetch `input_data` field from database
3. ReaderLayout couldn't extract chunk IDs to refetch
4. Connection queries hit URL length limits with 100+ chunk IDs

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **ChunkMetadataIcon reads from ReaderStore** (`src/components/reader/ChunkMetadataIcon.tsx`):
   - Subscribes to `useReaderStore(state => state.chunks)`
   - Finds fresh chunk by ID: `const freshChunk = storeChunks.find(c => c.id === chunk.id) || chunk`
   - Uses `freshChunk` for all metadata display
   - Result: Component automatically re-renders when store updates

2. **ReaderLayout detects enrichment completion** (`src/components/reader/ReaderLayout.tsx`):
   - Watches `jobsMap` for completed `enrich_chunks` or `enrich_and_connect` jobs
   - Extracts `chunk_ids` from `job.input_data`
   - Calls `refetchChunks(chunkIds)` to get fresh data from database
   - Calls `updateChunks(freshData)` to update ReaderStore
   - Result: Store updates trigger ChunkMetadataIcon re-render

3. **Added refetchChunks Server Action** (`src/app/actions/chunks.ts`):
   - Efficiently fetches only specified chunks by ID
   - Returns enrichment metadata: themes, summary, importance_score, etc.

4. **ReaderStore chunk update method** (`src/stores/reader-store.ts`):
   - `updateChunks(updatedChunks)`: Merges updated chunks by ID
   - Recalculates visible chunks to propagate changes
   - Uses Map for O(1) lookup performance

5. **Fixed BackgroundJobsStore polling** (`src/stores/admin/background-jobs.ts`):
   - Added `input_data` to SELECT query (line 389)
   - Added `input_data` to all `updateJob()` calls
   - Result: Job details now include chunk IDs for refetch

6. **Fixed connection query URL length issue** (`src/app/actions/connections.ts`):
   - Implemented batching: max 50 chunks per query
   - Prevents ERR_FAILED from URL length limits
   - Gracefully handles batch failures

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test steps
1. Open document with unenriched chunks
2. Click "Enrich Chunk" on metadata icon
3. Wait for job completion in ProcessingDock
4. ‚úÖ Metadata icon updates automatically with themes/summary!
5. ‚úÖ No page refresh needed
6. ‚úÖ No console errors
```

**Console Logs Confirmed**:
```
[ReaderLayout] üîç Found 1 new enrichment jobs to process
[ReaderLayout] üìã Job details: {input_data: {chunk_ids: [...]}}
[ReaderLayout] üîÑ Enrichment completed for 1 chunks, refreshing...
[ReaderLayout] üì• Fetched 1 updated chunks from database
[ReaderLayout] ‚úÖ Refreshed 1 chunks with new metadata
[ChunkMetadataIcon] Chunk X enrichment detected! Themes: [...]
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/reader/ChunkMetadataIcon.tsx` - Read from store
- `src/components/reader/ReaderLayout.tsx` - Detect completion, refetch, update
- `src/stores/reader-store.ts` - Add updateChunks method
- `src/app/actions/chunks.ts` - Add refetchChunks action, batch connections
- `src/stores/admin/background-jobs.ts` - Fetch input_data
- `src/components/admin/JobList.tsx` - Add enrichment job icons

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE and TESTED** (2025-10-27)

---

## üî¥ New Issues Found During Testing (2025-10-26 Evening Session)

### Critical: Job Completion Not Syncing to UI
**Symptoms**:
- Jobs appear in ProcessingDock and Admin Panel Jobs tab
- Worker logs show job completed successfully
- UI still shows "processing" status indefinitely
- Refreshing page doesn't update status
- Progress never advances (stuck at 0%)

**Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation
- Progress reporting code added to handlers
- Store polling every 2 seconds should detect completion
- May be schema mismatch (progress vs progress_percentage)

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check `background_jobs` table schema for progress fields
2. Verify store is reading correct fields
3. Add console logging to store polling
4. Check if job status is actually being updated in DB

**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks all enrichment testing

---

### UI Enhancements Needed

#### 1. Chunks Overview Tab - Enrichment Stats Missing
**Current State**: Tab shows total chunks, but no enrichment statistics

**Required**:
- **Enrichment Statistics Card**:
  - Total chunks count
  - Enriched chunks count (with percentage)
  - Unenriched chunks count
  - Skipped chunks count (by reason: user_choice, error, etc.)
  - Visual progress bar showing enrichment completion
- **Batch Actions**:
  - "Enrich All Unenriched" button (similar to existing batch connection detection)
  - Should respect user's original enrichment choice (don't override skipped_by_choice)
  - Show confirmation dialog with count: "Enrich 234 unenriched chunks?"
- **Stats Refresh**:
  - Auto-refresh stats when enrichment jobs complete
  - Manual refresh button

**Implementation Pattern**: Similar to ConnectionsTab statistics display

---

#### 2. All Chunks Tab - Missing Tooltip on Enrich Button
**Current State**: Sparkles button (‚ú®) exists but no tooltip

**Required**:
- Add hover tooltip: "Enrich Chunk" or "Enrich with Metadata"
- Consistent with other button tooltips in the interface
- Should explain what enrichment does in 5-10 words

**File**: `src/components/sidebar/AllChunksView.tsx` or chunk card component

---

#### 3. All Chunks Tab - "Select Unenriched" Filter Missing
**Current State**:
- "Detect Connections" button exists with smart selection
- Can select all chunks, but no way to filter by enrichment status

**Required**:
- **Selection UI Pattern** (copy from connections):
  - "Select All" button
  - **"Select Unenriched"** button (NEW)
  - "Select None" button
  - Selected count badge
- **Batch Enrich Button**:
  - Only visible when chunks selected
  - "Enrich Selected (X chunks)" with count
  - Shows progress in ProcessingDock
  - Updates UI when complete

**Visual Hierarchy**:
```
[Select All] [Select Unenriched] [Select None]   |   [X selected]
                                                    [Enrich Selected]
```

**Behavior**:
- "Select Unenriched" filters for `enrichments_detected = false` AND `enrichment_skipped_reason IS NULL`
- Don't select chunks that were deliberately skipped by user
- Gray out already-enriched chunks in selection mode

---

#### 4. Connection Detection - Auto-Enrich Dependency
**Current State**:
- Connection detection requires enrichment
- UI shows "(requires enrichment)" text
- But clicking "Detect Connections" fails if chunks aren't enriched

**Required**:
- **Smart Auto-Enrichment**:
  - When user clicks "Detect Connections" on unenriched chunk(s)
  - Automatically enrich first, then detect connections
  - Show two-phase progress: "Enriching (0-50%) ‚Üí Detecting (50-100%)"
  - Single job that does both sequentially
- **Implementation**:
  - Check chunk enrichment status before connection detection
  - If not enriched: Call `enrichAndConnectChunks()` instead of `detectConnectionsForChunks()`
  - If already enriched: Just call `detectConnectionsForChunks()`
- **User Experience**:
  - No error messages about "needs enrichment"
  - Seamless workflow: Click detect ‚Üí automatically enriches if needed ‚Üí detects
  - Progress indicator shows current phase

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/app/actions/connections.ts` - Add enrichment check
- `src/components/admin/tabs/ConnectionsTab.tsx` - Smart button behavior
- `src/components/sidebar/AllChunksView.tsx` - Smart button behavior

---

#### 5. ChunkMetadataIcon - Missing "Detect Connections" Button
**Current State**:
- Shows enrichment status section with "Enrich Chunk" and "Enrich & Connect"
- Shows connections status section BUT no action button
- Line 393-413 has the logic but button is MISSING

**Expected Behavior**:
```
Enrichment Section:
- If not enriched: [Enrich Chunk] [Enrich & Connect]
- If enriched: ‚úì Badge with timestamp

Connections Section:
- If not detected AND enriched: [Detect Connections] ‚Üê MISSING!
- If not detected AND not enriched: (requires enrichment) ‚Üê Currently shows this
- If detected: ‚úì Badge with timestamp
```

**Bug**: Line 393 condition `!metadata.connectionsDetected && metadata.enrichmentsDetected` exists, but button should show!

**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify `metadata.enrichmentsDetected` is actually true for enriched chunks
- Check if button is being rendered but hidden by CSS
- Verify chunk data includes `enrichments_detected` field

**File**: `src/components/reader/ChunkMetadataIcon.tsx` (lines 393-413)

---

## ‚úÖ Previously Fixed Issues (2025-10-26 Morning Session)

### Fixed Issues
1. ‚úÖ **Auto-resume bug**: FIXED with polling fallback (3-second detection)
   - Document appears automatically within 3 seconds
   - No manual refresh required
   - Supabase realtime WebSocket fails in local dev (expected, harmless)

2. ‚úÖ **Enrichment override**: FIXED with flag preservation
   - `enrichChunks` and `detectConnections` flags preserved through continue-processing
   - Original job flags fetched and passed to resume handler
   - Worker respects user choices correctly

3. ‚úÖ **Metadata transfer gaps**: FIXED with bulletproof matching
   - Added bulletproof matching step in continue-processing
   - Achieved 100% overlap coverage (339/339 chunks)
   - Gap-fill chunks (185 synthetic) are expected for EPUB (2-4 char whitespace gaps)
   - Average 2.12 overlaps per chunk (excellent)

### Previously Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ Review workflow field name mismatch
- ‚úÖ DocumentList polling detection
- ‚úÖ Obsidian URI capture and storage
- ‚úÖ Document appears immediately without refresh

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Ensure worker is running with latest code
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1/worker
npm start

# 2. Ensure Next.js dev server is running
cd /Users/topher/Code/rhizome-v2-dev-1
npm run dev

# 3. Check Supabase is running
npx supabase status
```

### Test Files
- **Small test**: Use a short EPUB/PDF (5-10 pages) for quick validation
- **Medium test**: 50-100 pages to verify batch operations
- **Large test**: 200+ pages to test performance (optional)

---

## Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Upload with Enrichment OFF (Fast Import)

**Purpose**: Verify enrichment skip works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to upload page
2. Select an EPUB/PDF file
3. In DocumentPreview:
   - ‚úÖ **UNCHECK** "Enrich chunks with metadata"
   - Verify "Detect connections" auto-disables and shows "(requires enrichment)"
   - Set workflow: "Fully Automatic"
4. Click "Confirm & Upload"
5. Monitor ProcessingDock and worker logs

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Document uploads successfully
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[DocumentProcessing] Skipping metadata enrichment (user opted out)"
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[ChunkEnrichmentManager] Marked chunks as unenriched (user_choice)"
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[DocumentProcessing] Skipping connection detection (user opted out)"
‚úÖ Document completes with status: 'completed'
‚úÖ Chunks in database have:
   - enrichments_detected = false
   - enrichment_skipped_reason = 'user_choice'
   - connections_detected = false
   - detection_skipped_reason = 'user_choice'
```

**Actual Results** (Tested 2025-10-26):
```
‚úÖ All expected results matched
‚úÖ Feature working correctly for fast import flow
```

**Database Verification**:
```sql
-- Check chunk enrichment status
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_chunks,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichments_detected = false) as unenriched,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichment_skipped_reason = 'user_choice') as skipped_by_choice
FROM chunks
WHERE document_id = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID';

-- Should show: total_chunks = unenriched = skipped_by_choice
```

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Review After Extraction (FIXED)

**Purpose**: Verify review workflow pauses correctly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to upload page
2. Select an EPUB file
3. In DocumentPreview:
   - ‚úÖ **CHECK** "Enrich chunks with metadata" (default)
   - Set workflow: **"Review After Extraction"**
4. Click "Confirm & Upload"
5. Wait for processing to pause

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Docling extracts markdown
‚úÖ Document status becomes: 'awaiting_manual_review'
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[Review] Pausing for docling_extraction review"
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[Review] Exporting to Obsidian..."
‚úÖ ProcessingDock shows: "Awaiting manual review"
‚úÖ DocumentList shows:
   - Badge: "awaiting_manual_review" with pause icon
   - Button: "Review in Obsidian"
   - Button: "Skip AI Cleanup"
   - Button: "Continue with AI Cleanup"
‚úÖ Document remains paused until user clicks a button
‚úÖ 0 chunks in database (not chunked yet)
```

**Actual Results** (Re-tested 2025-10-26 after fixes):
```
‚úÖ Document status becomes 'awaiting_manual_review'
‚úÖ Document appears automatically within 3 seconds (polling fallback)
‚úÖ Buttons appear in DocumentList
‚úÖ "Review in Obsidian" button opens Obsidian correctly
‚úÖ Document remains paused until user clicks resume button
‚úÖ Enrichment respects user choice (preserved through continue-processing)
‚úÖ Metadata transfer: 100% overlap coverage with bulletproof matching
‚úÖ 0 chunks in database before resume (correct - not chunked yet)
```

**Original Debug Actions (Now Resolved)**:
1. **Auto-resume investigation**:
   ```bash
   # Check for race conditions in continue-processing action
   grep -n "continueDocumentProcessing" src/app/actions/documents/continue-processing.ts

   # Check if review buttons auto-trigger on render
   grep -n "useEffect.*continueProcessing" src/components/library/DocumentList.tsx
   ```

2. **Enrichment override investigation**:
   ```bash
   # Check if enrichChunks flag is preserved during resume
   grep -n "enrichChunks" worker/handlers/continue-processing.ts

   # Check if resume job respects original flags
   psql -c "SELECT input_data FROM background_jobs WHERE job_type = 'continue_processing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
   ```

3. **Metadata transfer investigation**:
   ```bash
   # Check Docling chunk extraction
   grep -n "No Docling overlaps" worker/lib/metadata-transfer/*.ts

   # Verify Docling is extracting chunks properly
   # Check: worker/processors/epub-processor.ts extraction logic
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 3: Manual Enrichment via ChunkMetadataIcon

**Purpose**: Verify per-chunk enrichment UI works

**Steps**:
1. Upload document with enrichment OFF (use Scenario 1)
2. Navigate to `/read/[document-id]`
3. Hover over any chunk (left margin icon appears)
4. Click the metadata icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è)
5. In the hover card:
   - Verify "Enrichment" section shows "Not enriched"
   - Click "Enrich Chunk" button
6. Monitor ProcessingDock

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Toast: "Enrichment started" with "Check ProcessingDock for progress"
‚úÖ ProcessingDock shows: "Enriching chunk..."
‚úÖ Worker creates 'enrich_chunks' job
‚úÖ Worker logs show: "[EnrichChunksHandler] Starting job..."
‚úÖ ChunkEnrichmentManager enriches the single chunk
‚úÖ After completion:
   - Hover card shows "Enriched" badge
   - Enrichment timestamp appears
   - "Connection Detection" button becomes available
```

**Test Cases**:
- Single chunk enrichment
- "Enrich & Connect" button (sequential workflow)
- Verify enriched chunk has metadata populated

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 4: Manual Enrichment via ChunkCard

**Purpose**: Verify batch enrichment via chunk browser

**Steps**:
1. Upload document with enrichment OFF
2. Navigate to Admin Panel (Cmd+Shift+A) ‚Üí Connections tab
3. Click "Browse Chunks" for the document
4. Expand any chunk to detailed mode
5. Verify enrichment buttons appear
6. Click "Enrich Chunk" or "Enrich & Connect"

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Detailed mode shows:
   - "Enrich Chunk" button (outline variant)
   - "Enrich & Connect" button (primary variant)
‚úÖ After clicking "Enrich & Connect":
   - Toast shows progress
   - Worker runs enrichment (0-50%)
   - Worker runs connection detection (50-100%)
   - Both complete successfully
```

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 5: Batch Enrichment via EnrichmentsTab

**Purpose**: Verify Admin Panel enrichment management

**Steps**:
1. Upload document with enrichment OFF
2. Open Admin Panel (Cmd+Shift+A)
3. Navigate to **Tab 4: Enrichments**
4. Verify statistics display:
   - Total chunks
   - Enriched count (should be 0)
   - Pending count (should equal total)
   - Skipped count
5. Click "Enrich All Pending" button

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Statistics load correctly from database
‚úÖ Progress bar shows 0% enriched
‚úÖ "Enrich All Pending" button shows correct count
‚úÖ After clicking:
   - Toast: "Enriching X chunks"
   - ProcessingDock shows batch job
   - Worker creates 'enrich_chunks' job
   - All chunks get enriched
‚úÖ After completion:
   - Click "Refresh Statistics"
   - Progress bar shows 100%
   - "Enrich All Pending" becomes disabled (0 chunks)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 6: Connection Detection Dependency

**Purpose**: Verify connections require enrichment

**Steps**:
1. Upload document with enrichment OFF
2. Navigate to ChunkMetadataIcon hover card
3. Verify "Connection Detection" section shows:
   - Status: "Not detected"
   - Button: **NOT VISIBLE** (because not enriched)
4. Click "Enrich Chunk" and wait for completion
5. Verify "Detect Connections" button now appears

**Expected Results**:
```
‚úÖ Connection detection button only shows when chunk is enriched
‚úÖ Enforces dependency: enrichment ‚Üí connections
‚úÖ UI clearly indicates requirement
```

---

## Debug Priorities

### üî¥ Priority 1: Auto-Resume Bug

**Symptoms**:
- Document in `awaiting_manual_review` auto-resumes without user action
- Buttons appear but document processes immediately

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check if `continueProcessing` is called on component mount:
   ```typescript
   // src/components/library/DocumentList.tsx
   // Look for useEffect with continueProcessing call
   ```

2. Check if resume buttons have auto-trigger:
   ```typescript
   // Check onClick handlers don't fire immediately
   // Verify disabled state is respected
   ```

3. Check real-time subscription triggers:
   ```typescript
   // Line 68-87 in DocumentList.tsx
   // Does UPDATE event auto-trigger resume?
   ```

**Fix Strategy**:
- Add guard condition to prevent auto-resume
- Add console.log to track resume trigger source
- Verify `processing` state prevents double-clicks

---

### üî¥ Priority 2: Enrichment Override Bug

**Symptoms**:
- Document uploaded with enrichment OFF
- During review workflow resume, enrichment runs anyway

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check if `enrichChunks` flag is preserved in continue-processing job:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/actions/documents/continue-processing.ts
   // Does it pass enrichChunks to worker?
   ```

2. Check original job's `input_data`:
   ```sql
   SELECT input_data->'enrichChunks' as enrich_flag
   FROM background_jobs
   WHERE document_id = 'YOUR_DOC_ID'
   AND job_type = 'process_document';
   ```

3. Check if DocumentProcessingManager respects flag during resume:
   ```typescript
   // worker/lib/managers/document-processing-manager.ts
   // Line 115: if (this.options.enrichChunks !== false)
   // Is options.enrichChunks being set correctly?
   ```

**Fix Strategy**:
- Ensure `continue_processing` action fetches and forwards original flags
- Add logging to track enrichChunks value through resume flow
- Verify `enrichChunks` defaults to true only for new uploads, not resumes

---

### üü° Priority 3: Metadata Transfer Gaps

**Symptoms**:
- 80% of Chonkie chunks have no Docling overlaps
- Heavy reliance on interpolation instead of direct mapping

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check Docling chunk extraction quality:
   ```typescript
   // worker/processors/epub-processor.ts
   // Verify Docling extracts structural chunks properly
   ```

2. Check overlap detection algorithm:
   ```typescript
   // worker/lib/metadata-transfer/overlap-detector.ts
   // Are overlap thresholds too strict?
   ```

3. Analyze a specific document:
   ```bash
   # Export Docling chunks and Chonkie chunks for comparison
   # Check: Are Docling chunks too sparse?
   # Check: Are Chonkie chunks too granular?
   ```

**Expected Behavior**:
- 70-90% of chunks should have direct Docling overlaps
- 10-30% interpolation is normal (for small chunks, tables, etc.)
- Current: ~20% overlap, ~80% interpolation (REVERSED!)

**Fix Strategy**:
- Review Docling extraction parameters
- Adjust overlap threshold (currently may be too strict)
- Consider chunker strategy (recursive vs semantic)
- Verify Docling is enabled and working for EPUB

## Testing Checklist

### Upload Flow
- [ ] Upload with enrichment ON ‚Üí chunks enriched automatically
- [x] Upload with enrichment OFF ‚Üí chunks marked as skipped ‚úÖ
- [x] Connection detection disabled when enrichment OFF ‚úÖ
- [ ] Review workflow pauses correctly (BROKEN - needs fix)
- [ ] Resume respects original enrichment flag (BROKEN - needs fix)

### Manual Enrichment
- [ ] ChunkMetadataIcon shows enrichment status
- [ ] "Enrich Chunk" button triggers single-chunk job
- [ ] "Enrich & Connect" button runs sequential workflow
- [ ] ChunkCard shows enrichment buttons in detailed mode
- [ ] Enrichment buttons only show for unenriched chunks

### Batch Operations
- [ ] EnrichmentsTab displays statistics correctly
- [ ] "Enrich All Pending" triggers batch job
- [ ] Progress bar updates after enrichment
- [ ] Statistics refresh shows updated counts

### Dependency Enforcement
- [ ] Connection detection requires enrichment
- [ ] UI clearly indicates "(requires enrichment)"
- [ ] Connection button appears after enrichment completes

### Database State
- [x] `enrichments_detected` tracked correctly ‚úÖ
- [x] `enrichment_skipped_reason` set for user opt-out ‚úÖ
- [ ] Timestamps recorded properly
- [ ] No orphaned unenriched chunks after batch operation

---

## Performance Testing

### Fast Import Validation
**Goal**: Verify enrichment skip actually speeds up bulk imports

**Test**:
1. Upload 10 small PDFs with enrichment ON (baseline)
2. Upload 10 small PDFs with enrichment OFF (fast)
3. Compare total time

**Expected**:
- Enrichment OFF: ~50% faster
- Skip eliminates 30-60s per document (Ollama enrichment time)

---

## Log Monitoring

### Worker Logs to Watch
```bash
# Success indicators
‚úÖ "[DocumentProcessing] Skipping metadata enrichment (user opted out)"
‚úÖ "[ChunkEnrichmentManager] Marked chunks as unenriched (user_choice)"
‚úÖ "[EnrichChunksHandler] Starting job..."
‚úÖ "[EnrichAndConnectHandler] Step 1: Enriching..."
‚úÖ "[EnrichAndConnectHandler] Step 2: Detecting connections..."

# Error indicators
‚ùå "Cannot find package '@/lib'" (import path error - FIXED)
‚ùå "Property 'onProgress' does not exist" (interface error - FIXED)
‚ùå "[Metadata Transfer] chunk X has no Docling overlaps" (>80% = problem)
‚ùå Enrichment runs when enrichChunks=false (flag override bug)
```

### Database Queries for Validation
```sql
-- Check enrichment statistics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichments_detected = true) as enriched,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichment_skipped_reason = 'user_choice') as skipped,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enrichments_detected = false AND enrichment_skipped_reason IS NULL) as pending
FROM chunks
WHERE document_id = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID';

-- Check job types created
SELECT job_type, status, created_at
FROM background_jobs
WHERE input_data->>'document_id' = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Summary & Action Items

### ‚úÖ Critical Issues RESOLVED

**2025-10-26 Evening:**
1. **Job Completion Sync** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root cause: Worker writing to non-existent `progress_percentage` column
   - Solution: Updated handlers to only use `progress` JSONB field
   - Status: Jobs now complete and show progress correctly
   - Files: `worker/handlers/enrich-chunks.ts`, `worker/handlers/enrich-and-connect.ts`

2. **Document Title in Jobs** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Jobs now show: "Document Title - Chunk 123"
   - Passed `documentTitle` from reader store through BlockRenderer to ChunkMetadataIcon
   - Files: `src/components/reader/ChunkMetadataIcon.tsx`, `src/components/reader/BlockRenderer.tsx`

3. **ProcessingDock Global** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Moved to root layout, now appears on all pages
   - File: `src/app/layout.tsx`

**2025-10-27:**
4. **Chunk Metadata Refresh** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root causes: ChunkMetadataIcon using props instead of store, BackgroundJobsStore not fetching input_data
   - Solution: Subscribe to ReaderStore, add refetch mechanism, fix polling
   - Status: Metadata icons update automatically after enrichment completes
   - Files: See "Fixes Implemented (2025-10-27 Session)" section above

5. **Connection Query URL Length Error** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root cause: 100+ chunk IDs in single query exceeded browser URL limits
   - Solution: Implemented batching (50 chunks per query)
   - Status: No more ERR_FAILED errors on scroll
   - File: `src/app/actions/connections.ts`

### üü° UI Enhancements Required
1. **Chunks Overview Tab** - Add enrichment statistics and batch actions
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Impact: Core workflow for managing enrichment at document level

3. **All Chunks Tab - Select Unenriched** - Missing filter and batch enrich
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Impact: Bulk enrichment workflow

4. **Connection Detection Auto-Enrich** - Should auto-enrich if needed
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Impact: Better UX, removes error state

5. **ChunkMetadataIcon - Detect Connections Button** - Button missing
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Impact: Per-chunk connection detection workflow

6. **All Chunks Tab - Tooltip** - Missing sparkles button tooltip
   - Priority: LOW
   - Impact: Minor UX improvement

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Enrichment skip during upload (fast import) ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ Chunk Refresh Strategy (IMPLEMENTED 2025-10-27)

**See "Fixes Implemented (2025-10-27 Session)" section above for complete implementation details.**

**Key Points**:
- ChunkMetadataIcon subscribes to ReaderStore, not props
- ReaderLayout detects job completion via BackgroundJobsStore
- Only affected chunks refetched (selective refresh)
- React reconciliation ensures only ChunkMetadataIcon re-renders
- No full page reload needed

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and tested
