# Create Implementation Tasks

Read the spec and:

1. **Break into Phases** (Core → Validation → Cleanup)
2. **Create Granular Tasks** (each task = 15-30 min of work)
3. **Add Resume Context** (notes for picking up later)
4. **Include Quick Reference** (commands, key files)

Save to: `docs/tasks/{feature-name}.md`

Optimize for: "Can I resume mid-implementation without re-reading everything?"
