# Brainstorm Feature Decision

Have a conversation with the user about:
1. The problem they're solving
2. Options they see (2-4 approaches)
3. Trade-offs of each
4. Which approach they're choosing

Then:
1. Search codebase for similar patterns
2. Document the exploration
3. Save to: `docs/brainstorming/{feature-name}.md`

Keep it conversational. Focus on capturing WHY they chose this path.
