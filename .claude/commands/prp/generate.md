# Create PRP

## Feature file: $ARGUMENTS

Generate a complete PRP (Product Requirements & Plans) for general feature
implementation with thorough research. This workflow includes an initial
discovery phase to validate task completeness before comprehensive research
begins.

## Workflow Summary

- Phase 1 discovery identifies missing business logic early
- Two-phase approach ensures complete requirements before development
- Better input quality leads to higher-quality PRP outputs

Ensure context is passed to the AI agent to enable self-validation and iterative
refinement. Read the feature file first to understand what needs to be created,
how the examples provided help, and any other considerations.

The AI agent only gets the context you are appending to the PRP and training
data. Assume the AI agent has access to the codebase and the same knowledge
cutoff as you, so it's important that your research findings are included or
referenced in the PRP. The Agent has Websearch capabilities, so pass urls to
documentation and examples.

## Research Process

**Phase 1: Initial Discovery & Task Validation** (Validate task completeness
before deep research)

1. **Preflight Analysis** (Use subagent: `preflight-prp`)
   - Quick scan of project structure for similar features/patterns
   - Analyze user's task description for business logic completeness
   - Identify gaps in user requirements and missing business logic details:
     - User flows and interaction patterns
     - Data requirements and relationships
     - Integration points with existing features
     - Edge cases and error scenarios
     - UI/UX expectations and constraints
   - **Language Guidelines for Questions**: 
     - Ask clarification questions in the same language the user wrote the initial task
     - Wait for user responses and analyze thoroughly
   - Generate targeted clarification questions if gaps identified
   - Make proceed/clarify recommendation with clear reasoning

2. **Decision Gate**:
   - **IF** preflight-prp recommends PROCEED → Continue to Phase 2
   - **IF** preflight-prp identifies gaps → Stop and ask clarifying
     questions
   - **ONLY** continue to comprehensive research after user provides missing
     details
   - Use surface discovery findings to inform Phase 2 research focus

**Phase 2: Comprehensive Research Phase** (After task validation - Codebase
first, then smart external research)

1. **Codebase Analysis** (Use subagent: `codebase-research`)
   - Search for similar features/patterns in the codebase
   - Identify files to reference in PRP
   - Note existing conventions to follow
   - Check test patterns for validation approach
   - **CRITICAL**: Document what components/libraries/patterns already exist
   - **ASSESS**: Determine knowledge gaps that truly need external research

2. **Smart External Research Decision** (Evaluate AFTER codebase analysis)

   **FIRST: Analyze codebase findings to determine if external research is
   needed:**

   **SKIP External Research if:**
   - ✅ Similar components/patterns found in codebase (internal project
     components)
   - ✅ Clear implementation path from existing code
   - ✅ Standard CRUD/UI operations using existing patterns
   - ✅ Internal utility functions/services already available

   **PROCEED with External Research ONLY if:**
   - ❌ New external npm/library integration needed (get current docs)
   - ❌ Existing external library usage but complex/undocumented features
     needed
   - ❌ Complex algorithm or pattern not in codebase
   - ❌ Security/performance considerations beyond current code
   - ❌ External API integration without existing examples
   - ❌ **No similar patterns/components found in codebase** (need external
     examples)

   **If External Research is needed** (Use subagent: `research-agent`):
   - Focus ONLY on missing knowledge gaps identified above
   - External npm/library documentation for NEW packages or complex features
   - Best practices for COMPLEX patterns not in codebase
   - Security considerations for NEW external integrations
   - **AVOID**: Researching internal project components (use codebase instead)
   - **Agent returns all findings directly in response context**

3. **Technical Clarification** (Use if needed after research completion)
   - **ONLY** for technical implementation details, not business logic
   - Specific patterns to mirror and where to find them?
   - Integration requirements and where to find them?
   - Which existing service to use and its file path?
   - Confirm if external research is truly needed for identified gaps

## Language Guidelines

### User Interaction Language
- **Questions & Communication**: Ask all clarification questions in the same language the user wrote the initial task
- **Analysis & Discussion**: Continue using the user's language throughout the discovery and research phases

### PRP Document Language  
- **Final Document**: Always write the PRP document in English for consistency and international team compatibility
- **User Response Translation**: When incorporating user responses into the PRP, translate them to English while preserving the original meaning
- **Code Examples**: Always use English comments and variable names in technical examples
- **Technical Terms**: Use standard English technical terminology in the final document

## PRP Generation

Using docs/templates/prp_document_template.md as template:

### Critical Context to Include and pass to the AI agent as part of the PRP

- **Discovery Findings**: Document Phase 1 findings and any user clarifications
  received
- **Business Logic**: Complete requirements gathered from user interactions
- **Code Examples**: Real snippets from codebase (PRIMARY FOCUS)
- **Patterns**: Existing approaches to follow (MIRROR THESE)
- **Documentation**: URLs ONLY for new/missing knowledge gaps
- **Research Integration**: All external research findings are provided directly in agent response context for immediate integration into PRP
- **Gotchas**: Library quirks, version issues from codebase analysis
- **Research Justification**: Explain why external research was/wasn't needed

### Implementation Blueprint

- Start with pseudocode showing approach
- Reference real files for patterns
- Include error handling strategy
- list tasks to be completed to fullfill the PRP in the order they should be
  completed

### Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

**During Codebase Research Phase**, identify and document available project
validation tools:

- Analyze project configuration files for validation commands (package.json,
  Makefile, pyproject.toml, setup.py, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)
- Identify linting, testing, and formatting tools specific to the project's tech
  stack
- Document exact validation commands found in the project
- Include these validation commands directly in the PRP document
- Ensure all code changes will pass project validation standards
- Add specific validation steps to PRP task list with exact commands to run

**CRITICAL AFTER YOU ARE DONE RESEARCHING AND EXPLORING THE CODEBASE BEFORE YOU
START WRITING THE PRP**

**ULTRATHINK ABOUT THE PRP AND PLAN YOUR APPROACH THEN START WRITING THE PRP**

## Output

Save as: `docs/prps/{feature-name}.md`

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All necessary context included
- [ ] Validation gates are executable by AI
- [ ] References existing patterns
- [ ] Clear implementation path
- [ ] Error handling documented

Score the PRP on a scale of 1-10 (confidence level to succeed in one-pass
implementation using claude codes)

## Task Breakdown Generation

**Final Step: Generate Implementation Tasks**

After completing the PRP document, automatically generate a detailed task breakdown:

1. **Task Decomposition** (Use subagent: `team-lead-task-breakdown`)
   - Analyze the completed PRP document
   - Break down the implementation into manageable development tasks
   - Apply work breakdown structure (WBS) principles
   - Create appropriately-sized tasks for team capacity
   - Define clear dependencies and critical path
   - Generate acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format
   - Save task breakdown to `docs/tasks/{feature-name}.md`

2. **Integration with PRP**
   - Reference the task breakdown document in the PRP
   - Update PRP document to include link to `docs/tasks/{feature-name}.md`
   - Ensure alignment between PRP requirements and task definitions
   - Provide clear handoff to development team

This ensures the PRP includes both comprehensive requirements AND actionable implementation tasks ready for development sprints.

Remember: The goal is one-pass implementation success through comprehensive
context AND clear task decomposition.
