# Execute BASE PRP

Implement a feature using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
    - Read the specified PRP file
    - Understand all context and requirements
    - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
    - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
    - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed

2. **Plan Implementation**
    - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan
      addressing all requirements.
    - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos
      tools.
    - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
    - **CRITICAL**: Study reference files specified in PRP - understand their
      exact structure, patterns, and organization.
    - **ALWAYS**: Mirror the reference implementation patterns exactly - same
      file organization, naming conventions, component structure, and code
      patterns.

3. **Execute the plan**
    - **BEFORE coding each component**: Read the corresponding reference file to
      understand its exact structure
    - **FOR each task**: Look at reference implementation first, then adapt the
      pattern for your feature
    - Execute the PRP following reference patterns exactly
    - Implement all the code using established patterns

4. **Validate**
    - Run each validation command
    - Fix any failures
    - Re-run until all pass

5. **Complete**
    - Ensure all checklist items done
    - Run final validation suite
    - Report completion status
    - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything

6. **Reference the PRP**
    - You can always reference the PRP again if needed

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.
